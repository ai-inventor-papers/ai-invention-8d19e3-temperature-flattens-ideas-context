<ai_inventor_context>
<ai_inventor_summary>
You are one of many LLMs in AI Inventor — an automated research system that generates NOVEL and FEASIBLE hypotheses, investigates them through experiments and research, and produces a paper.

Your output feeds other LLMs downstream. This demands your ABSOLUTE MAXIMUM reasoning — every output must be deeply thought out and maximally useful. Surface-level responses waste downstream computation.
</ai_inventor_summary>

<your_role>
YOU ARE: A plan generator (Step 3.2: GEN_PLAN in the invention loop)

You received the hypothesis, an artifact direction to elaborate, and dependency artifacts relevant to the plan.
Your job: elaborate this direction into a detailed, actionable plan for the executor agent.

Specific, actionable plan → valuable artifact. Vague plan → wasted execution.
</your_role>
</ai_inventor_context>

<artifact_type_info>
You are expanding an artifact direction of type: EXPERIMENT

EXPERIMENT
Run code to test hypotheses, implement methods, and collect empirical results.
Runtime: Python 3.12, UV (any pip package), isolated workspace, gradual scaling (mini → full data).
Tools: Full shell/Python/filesystem access, the aii-web-tools skill (web search, page fetch, regex grep over full page/PDF text), and other skills.
Skills: aii-json (schema validation), aii-openrouter-llms (call any LLM — GPT, Gemini, Llama, etc.), domain-specific as needed.
Capabilities: Implement and run any code-based experiment, compare method vs baselines.
Deps: REQUIRED at least one DATASET once the pool has one | OPTIONAL RESEARCH for methodology guidance

<available_resources>
<software_constraints>
- Python for all code, except a PROOF artifact's Lean 4 (aii-lean skill)
- Python standard library and all popular PyPI packages available (numpy, pandas, scikit-learn, scipy, matplotlib, requests, etc.)
- Local parallelism encouraged: multiprocessing, asyncio, threading — see aii-parallel-computing skill
- LLM API calls must go through OpenRouter only (no direct OpenAI, Anthropic, etc.), with base_url=os.environ["OPENROUTER_BASE_URL"] and api_key=os.environ["OPENROUTER_API_KEY"] (the OpenAI SDK's defaults, OPENAI_BASE_URL and OPENAI_API_KEY, point at the same place, so a plain OpenAI() client also works with OpenRouter model ids). The key is this run's own OpenRouter key and works only at that base URL: never hard-code OpenRouter's own URL, or every call fails with 401
- **SPEND BUDGET**: OpenRouter budget for this phase of the run (Test Idea): $7 USD for the ENTIRE Test Idea phase, start to finish. This is ONE pot shared by every agent, subagent and step in this phase, not a per-agent, per-subagent or per-artifact allowance: other agents in this phase are drawing on this same $7 USD right now, including ones you never see. The run's other phases have pots of their own, and this phase cannot borrow from them. Every paid OpenRouter call counts against it: LLM calls from your code or the terminal, and image generation. Your own ceiling for THIS artifact is a smaller limit that sits inside that shared total: spend at most $7 USD here, and less when the work allows or you are unsure, preferring cheaper models. The phase's budget is enforced by AI Inventor, not by OpenRouter: once it is spent, every paid OpenRouter call is refused with HTTP 403 and an error whose message starts 'AI Inventor per-run OpenRouter budget' (retrying will not help; ':free' models keep working). The first such refusal ends a whole batch: stop every call still queued or in flight (check for it after a concurrent call gets its slot, not only before it waits for one) instead of letting each be refused in turn, and do not rerun the batch. GET <base_url>/key reports this phase's limit and what is left of it. Your per-artifact share is not enforced for you: read each response's usage.cost, keep a running total and stop when you approach it. Budget the work up front: estimate the per-call cost and the number of calls BEFORE starting a sweep, not after it overruns. Every call spends real money that the run cannot recover, and a sweep refused halfway costs the run its results.

<time_budget>

The experiment executor has 6h total (including writing code, debugging, testing, and fixing errors).

</time_budget>

<available_tools>
You have no shell in this step, so the aii-web-tools skill's scripts cannot run. Use the web
search and page fetch tools your harness provides, if it provides any: search to discover and
scan, then fetch the pages that matter. If you have no web tool, plan from the direction and its
dependencies, and name in the plan what the executor must look up or verify.
</available_tools>

<tool_use>
Maximize parallel tool calls. Parallelize independent operations, only sequentialize dependencies.
- Multiple searches/fetches on different topics → parallel in one turn
- Search then fetch results → sequential (need URLs first)
</tool_use>

<plan_guidelines>
You are expanding an artifact direction from the strategy into a detailed plan.
The artifact direction specifies what to do at a high level (type, objective, approach, dependencies).
Your job is to make it concrete and actionable as a detailed plan.
Use web research to look up technical details, verify feasibility, and find reference materials
that will make your plan more concrete and actionable for the executor.

GOOD PLANS:
- Make each component SPECIFIC and actionable (not vague platitudes)
- Consider both success AND failure scenarios
- Build on the approach in the artifact direction
- Add concrete details the executor needs

BAD PLANS:
- Vague hand-waving ("do research on X")
- Ignoring the approach in the artifact direction
- Missing critical details the executor needs
</plan_guidelines>

<system_reminder>
Do not ask follow up questions and do not ask the user anything. Execute all steps independently.
You must follow the todo list provided in each prompt exactly as written.
No placeholders, stubs, or incomplete code — all code must be complete and functional.

<workspace>
Your workspace: `/ai-inventor/aii_data/runs/run_wfWEMjpWKygr/3_invention_loop/iter_1/gen_plan/gen_plan_experiment_3`

CRITICAL: Every file you create, write, or save MUST be inside this workspace directory (subdirectories OK). You MUST NOT write files anywhere outside this path — external paths are READ-ONLY. Use absolute paths for all file operations.

EVERY file write MUST start with `/ai-inventor/aii_data/runs/run_wfWEMjpWKygr/3_invention_loop/iter_1/gen_plan/gen_plan_experiment_3/`:
GOOD: `/ai-inventor/aii_data/runs/run_wfWEMjpWKygr/3_invention_loop/iter_1/gen_plan/gen_plan_experiment_3/file.py`, `/ai-inventor/aii_data/runs/run_wfWEMjpWKygr/3_invention_loop/iter_1/gen_plan/gen_plan_experiment_3/results/out.json`
BAD: `/tmp/file.py`, `~/output.json`, `./file.py`, any path outside the workspace
</workspace>
<disposable_outputs>
YOUR WORKING DIRECTORY IS A DELIVERABLE. When this module ends it must read
like a GitHub repository someone else can fork, resume and run — and the bulk
it holds must be either worth keeping or restorable. This run shares a storage
volume with the database; a run that fills it stops every other run on the box.

So before you finish, produce TWO files:

1. `.aii/manifest.yaml` — one entry per heavy path, each with EXACTLY ONE decision.
   The `.aii/` directory ALREADY EXISTS in your cwd: write the file into
   it. Do not create, replace or `touch` `.aii` itself — a plain file by
   that name makes the manifest unwritable for the rest of the module.

```yaml
entries:
  - path: results/
    keep: six GPU-hours of sweep output, not reproducible inside this run
  - path: hf_cache/
    delete: redownloadable
    source: "huggingface-cli download meta-llama/Llama-3-8B"
  - path: checkpoints/
    delete: regenerable
    source: "uv run train.py --epochs 3 --seed 0"
```

   - `keep:` takes a ONE-LINE reason. Use it for the expensive and the
     irreproducible: trained weights, long-running results, datasets you
     collected yourself.
   - `delete:` takes `redownloadable` (and a `source:` naming the repo id, URL
     or command) or `regenerable` (and a `source:` that is the command which
     rebuilds it). These are deleted AFTER the round ends, never mid-step.
   - Every path is RELATIVE TO YOUR CWD and must resolve INSIDE it. Absolute
     paths, `..`, and anything resolving outside are rejected.
   - Globs and whole directories are fine. A whole `hf_cache/` is ONE entry —
     do not list files individually.

2. `README.md` — written as if your cwd were a GitHub repository: what you
   did, the layout with a line per important file/directory, how to run it,
   and a **"Restoring removed files"** section giving the install/download
   command for EVERY `delete` entry. An `install.sh` or `restore.sh` beside it
   is welcome.

A CHECKER RUNS WHEN YOU SUBMIT. If anything heavy has no decision it fails
your submission and hands you the uncovered list, grouped by directory with
sizes, and you fix the manifest and submit again.

WHAT NEEDS NO DECISION — do not write entries for these:
- text and code files, at ANY size (source, JSON, CSV, YAML, logs, markdown);
- anything under the auto-keep floor (10 MB), whatever it holds.
Only large binaries and cache directories (`hf_cache/`, `.venv/`,
`node_modules/`, `checkpoints/`, `wandb/`, `__pycache__/`, …) need one.

NEVER mark your results, figures, papers, code, logs or anything a later step
reads as `delete`. If a later step needs it, it is a `keep`.

WHAT A `keep` BUYS YOU. Anything you do not mark `delete` stays exactly where
you wrote it, on this run's storage volume, at the path it already has — it is
not moved, renamed or copied. A later round reads it there, by that absolute
workspace path, so a checkpoint you keep is a checkpoint the next round can
load instead of retraining. It is also the ONLY copy: the publish step pushes
your cwd to GitHub but skips every file of 100 MB or
more, so trained weights and large binary artifacts never leave the volume.
Name each kept artifact in your results and your `README.md` by its path
RELATIVE to your cwd, and say it stays on the run's volume rather than in the
published repository. Never write an absolute server path into a file that is
published: a reader's machine has none of them.

<hypothesis>
kind: hypothesis
title: Temperature Flattens Ideas, Context Reorders Them
hypothesis: >-
  When an instruction-tuned open-weight LLM (>=1B parameters) is asked an open design task such as 'implement a path search
  algorithm', which solution idea it picks (BFS, DFS, Dijkstra, A*, bidirectional, ...) works like a discrete choice. That
  choice is made at a few early COMMITMENT TOKENS, and at those tokens the residual stream carries a readable IDEA-UTILITY
  VECTOR u: one score per candidate idea, read from the logits or the logit lens at the commitment position, or from a linear
  probe on the state just before it. This vector, together with the similarity geometry of the ideas' internal representations,
  PREDICTS BEFORE GENERATION what each 'creativity knob' will do. Each knob acts on a different parameter of one random-utility
  model. (1) TEMPERATURE only rescales u. Idea log-odds therefore fall on straight Arrhenius lines, ln[P_T(j)/P_T(mode)] ~
  -(u_mode - u_j)/T, with slopes equal to the internal utility gaps. Temperature can flatten the idea distribution but never
  reorder it, and phrasing diversity grows far faster than idea diversity: the user's case (a) '1 idea x many phrasings',
  and with top-k=10 a hard ceiling equal to the number of idea tokens inside the top-k at the commitment position. (2) RANDOM
  CONTEXT SEEDS ('seed=d32qxk4nt43', '(horse chair roof love)') act as random utility shocks with a measurable internal spread
  sigma_seed. They change the chosen idea only when sigma_seed is comparable to the utility gap, which explains why seeding
  fails on canonical tasks like weighted shortest path -> Dijkstra. (3) BANS restrict the choice set but break the independence
  of irrelevant alternatives (IIA): the banned idea's probability flows mainly to its nearest neighbours in the model's internal
  idea geometry, as in a nested logit, rather than to the remaining ideas in proportion to their base rates. 'Banning the
  attractor creates an adjacent attractor', e.g. Dijkstra -> SPFA. (4) NOVELTY INSTRUCTIONS shift u along a single typicality
  axis. The 'default answer' is therefore the MODE of the internal utility landscape, not an average of possible answers,
  and only interventions that change u (context, or direct steering at the commitment layer) can reorder ideas or reach ones
  outside the usual menu.
motivation: >-
  People reach for temperature as the 'creativity knob' and for 'be original'/'don't use X' prompts as the novelty lever.
  Behavioral studies, though, show that temperature mostly adds surface variation (Peeperkorn et al. 2024), that incidental
  cues swing algorithm choice by up to 100 percentage points with no mechanism identified (Invisible Lottery, 2026), and that
  banning the dominant solution simply produces a new dominant one: the DrejcPesjak/llm-creativity repo saw 16 of 25 programs
  collapse to SPFA under a ban list, while random seeds had zero effect. Nobody has a model that PREDICTS these outcomes,
  so practitioners tune knobs blindly. If idea choice is a readable discrete choice, one internal measurement (the utility
  vector and the idea geometry at the commitment token) tells you in advance: whether temperature can reach a new idea at
  a tolerable temperature (only if the gap is small), whether seeding will do anything (only if sigma_seed is comparable to
  the gap), and where a ban will send the model (to the banned idea's neighbour, not to something novel). It also says what
  WILL produce new ideas: acting on u directly at the commitment point. That turns the folk question 'is the LLM just giving
  me the average answer?' into a measurable claim (mode of a utility landscape, not a mean) and turns creativity control from
  prompt lore into a predictable intervention. It also directly answers the user's questions (a)/(b)/(c) about temperature
  and top-k, the seeding question, the 'average answer' question, and the 'ban the top-5: does mass move to the edge or the
  opposite side of the manifold?' question.
assumptions:
- >-
  For algorithm-design prompts, the idea is fixed within the first few dozen generated tokens, typically at an algorithm-name
  token in the preamble ('Here is an implementation of A*') or at a data-structure token (deque vs heapq vs a stack/recursion).
  Forking-path resampling (Bigelow et al. 2025) can locate this point, so a per-sample commitment position exists for most
  samples.
- >-
  Generated solutions can be classified reliably into idea classes with a deterministic AST/keyword classifier (deque+popleft
  -> BFS, heapq without a heuristic -> Dijkstra, heapq plus a heuristic -> A*, explicit stack or recursion -> DFS, repeated
  edge relaxation -> Bellman-Ford/SPFA, two frontiers -> bidirectional, otherwise 'other/novel'), checked by running the code
  on random graphs against an oracle, as in the llm-creativity repo.
- >-
  Mid-layer residual representations of the commitment window, meaning the mean over the commitment token plus the next ~16
  tokens, give a stable, seed-robust geometry of ideas (centroid cosine similarities). This geometry is computed ONLY from
  unbanned baseline runs, so it can predict substitution under bans out of sample.
- >-
  The instruction-tuned models used are not so mode-collapsed that the baseline menu has only one idea. At T=1, at least 3
  idea classes occur with >=3% frequency on at least 2 of the 3 tasks; this is checked in the first screening step, and tasks
  failing it are swapped.
- >-
  GPU inference is available for the experiment phase (a single 24-48 GB GPU via the aii-runpod skill; the local machine has
  2 CPU cores and no GPU). vLLM handles sampling and HuggingFace/TransformerLens with forward hooks handles activations. CPU
  fallback: Qwen2.5-1.5B-Instruct, outputs capped at 160 tokens (enough to classify the idea, since commitment is early),
  n=40 per cell.
investigation_approach: |-
  MODELS: Qwen2.5-3B-Instruct (primary) and gemma-2-2b-it (second family; has public Gemma Scope SAEs for feature-level naming). Llama-3.2-3B-Instruct is optional for replication. TASKS (3): T1 'Implement a path search algorithm in Python' (open menu), T2 'Implement a sorting algorithm' (large menu: quick/merge/heap/insertion/radix/counting/shell/...), T3 'Implement a function that finds a shortest path in a weighted graph' (the canonical Dijkstra attractor, as in the repo). Same base seed everywhere, as the user asked.

  PHASE 1, BEHAVIOR (the user's a/b/c questions). Grid: T in {0.3, 0.5, 0.7, 1.0, 1.3, 1.6} x top-k in {10, none}, n=100 samples per cell per task. Classify each sample's idea, run its code against an oracle on 50 random graphs/arrays, and measure phrasing diversity within each idea (normalized-code edit distance and embedding distance). Partition diversity ecologically: Hill numbers between ideas (beta) vs within ideas (alpha). This answers (a) vs (b) vs (c) directly. Conditions: baseline; 'Make a new algorithm'; 'Make a fully novel algorithm never seen before... 2000 words'; 3 random-character seeds and 3 random-word seeds x 30 seed strings each; bans of the top-1/top-3/top-5 baseline ideas; and a control ban of a rare idea (tests priming, cf. Semantic Gravity Wells). Bans run at T=0.7, n=100.

  PHASE 2, LOCATE THE CHOICE. For 60 baseline samples per task, run forking-path resampling: at each of the first 64 positions, resample 10 continuations and classify them. The commitment token is the first position after which the idea distribution stays fixed. Then test a probe and the logit lens: at each layer, does the residual stream at the commitment token, and at the prompt-final token, linearly predict the final idea? This gives the layer and position where the choice forms. Causal check: patch the commitment-token residual from a BFS run into a Dijkstra run at the identified layers and measure the idea flip rate (with a random-position patch as control).

  PHASE 3, READ THE CHOICE MODEL (all from baseline runs only). u = log-probabilities at the commitment position over each idea's identifying tokens, cross-checked with a multinomial probe on the pre-commitment residual. Geometry S = cosine similarity between idea centroids of commitment-window activations at the best probe layer. Draw the 'path-search algorithm manifold' the user asked for: PCA/UMAP of the activations, centroids sized by count, then the same plot after bans with arrows showing where mass moved.

  PHASE 4, PREDICT EVERY KNOB OUT OF SAMPLE. (i) Temperature: fit an Arrhenius line per idea and correlate its slope with the internal gap u_mode-u_j. Predicted top-k ceiling = the number of idea tokens in the top-k at commitment. Count rank reversals. (ii) Seeds: measure sigma_seed as the spread of u across seed prefixes. Predicted greedy flip rate = P(argmax changes under Gaussian shocks of size sigma_seed), compared with the observed rate on each task. (iii) Bans: compare three predictors of the post-ban idea distribution: IIA-proportional renormalization of the baseline; behavioral co-occurrence similarity; and a geometry nested logit P'(j) proportional to P(j) * (1 + lambda * sum_banned b of S_jb * P(b)), where lambda is fitted on one task and tested on the other two. Score them by Jensen-Shannon divergence and held-out log-likelihood. Edge vs opposite side: check whether post-ban mass sits closer in S to the banned centroids than the baseline-weighted average does. (iv) Novelty instructions: regress the shift in u on log baseline frequency to get a single 'typicality' slope.

  PHASE 5, INFLUENCE IT. At the commitment layer and position, add a steering vector built from the utility-probe weights that FLATTENS u (an internal version of 'generate the menu, then pick at random'). Also test projecting out the subspace spanned by the menu-idea centroids, which aims for ideas outside the menu. Compare against temperature, bans and seeds at matched pass rate on idea entropy, outside-menu share and correctness. Name the features involved with Gemma Scope SAE latents on gemma-2-2b-it (e.g. 'priority queue', 'level-order') and list which ones the steering moves.

  COST: roughly 20k generations of <=400 tokens (about 1-2 GPU-hours with vLLM on a 3B model) plus about 4k activation-cached forward passes and about 40k forking-path rollouts of 64 tokens (about 1-2 GPU-hours). No paid LLM calls are needed, since classification is rule-based with code execution.
success_criteria: >-
  CONFIRM if most of the following hold on both models. (1) Commitment is localized: for >=75% of samples the idea is fixed
  within the first 48 generated tokens, and patching the commitment-token residual flips the idea in >=50% of trials vs <10%
  for a random-position patch. (2) Temperature law: the Arrhenius fits ln-odds vs 1/T reach R^2>=0.85 for ideas with >=3%
  frequency at T=1; the slopes correlate with the internal gaps u_mode-u_j (Spearman >=0.7); there are no rank reversals among
  the top-3 ideas for T<=1.3; within-idea phrasing diversity rises >=3x more steeply with T than idea count; and with top-k=10
  the number of distinct ideas never exceeds the predicted ceiling. (3) Seeds: the shock model predicts the per-task flip
  rate within +/-0.10, and seeds are ineffective (<5% flips) exactly on tasks where gap/sigma_seed>3 (expected for T3). (4)
  Bans: the geometry nested logit beats IIA-proportional renormalization by >=20% lower Jensen-Shannon divergence on held-out
  tasks and bans; in >=70% of single bans the top substitute is the banned idea's nearest internal neighbour; and post-ban
  mass lies on the 'edge' (closer to the banned centroids than the baseline average is). (5) Influence: commitment-point flattening
  at least doubles idea entropy relative to the best temperature at equal pass rate (>=80% pass), while bans mostly reshuffle
  within the menu (outside-menu share <15%). DISCONFIRM / redirect: curved Arrhenius plots or rank reversals with rising T
  would mean commitment is spread over many tokens and ideas reachable by many paths gain at high T (alternate A1). Geometry
  predicting no better than IIA would mean bans redistribute proportionally (the choice set is unstructured). Post-ban mass
  moving AWAY from the banned centroids would mean ban-induced repulsion through shared features (alternate A3). Each of these
  is still an informative mechanistic finding about how the knobs act.

  DrejcPesjak/llm-creativity (GitHub, 2026): behavioral study of one weighted shortest-path task with claude-sonnet-5. Seeds
  had no effect; a negative-memory ban list pushed 16/25 programs to SPFA ('banning the attractor creates a new one'); 'selection
  is the bottleneck'. It uses a closed model with uncontrolled temperature and does no internal analysis. We use its findings
  as phenomena to PREDICT from internal utilities and geometry.

  The Invisible Lottery: How Subtle Cues Steer Algorithm Choice in LLM Code Generation (arXiv 2606.04057): 46k runs showing
  that incidental cues shift algorithm-family distributions by up to 100 pp, with temperature sweeps. Purely behavioral: it
  has a token log-probability diagnostic 'without identifying a mechanism' and leaves activation patching and causal mediation
  to future work. It does not cover bans, substitution structure, or prediction of knob effects. We provide the internal choice
  model that predicts such shifts.
- >-
  Forking Paths in Neural Text Generation (Bigelow et al., ICLR 2025): resamples tokens along a path to find forks where outcomes
  diverge. We use it as an instrument to locate commitment tokens. Our contribution is the idea-level utility readout at those
  forks and its use to predict temperature, seed and ban effects quantitatively.
- >-
  Manifold Steering (Wurgaft et al., arXiv 2605.05115; Goodfire): shows that activation manifolds mirror behavior manifolds
  (weekdays, months) and that steering along the manifold beats linear steering. Their concepts have known cyclic structure
  and no choice-set restriction. We use the geometry of solution ideas to predict where probability goes when ideas are prohibited
  (an IIA test), which has not been studied.
- >-
  Semantic Gravity Wells: Why Negative Constraints Backfire (arXiv 2601.08070): logit lens and patching show that naming a
  forbidden word primes it, causing violations. It studies whether the banned item leaks, not where probability goes instead.
  Our ban analysis concerns the substitution structure among the remaining ideas, with a rare-idea ban as a priming control.
- >-
  The Innate Economic Preferences of Language Models (Buchanan & Foster, arXiv 2607.26288): notes that LLM generation is isomorphic
  to a random-utility model and finds IIA violations across prompts in portfolio choices. It does not cover idea generation,
  commitment tokens, representation geometry, or a mapping of creativity knobs onto choice-model parameters. The RUM framing
  itself is not our novelty; reading it from internals at the commitment point and using it to predict knob effects is.
- >-
  Is Temperature the Creativity Parameter of LLMs? (Peeperkorn et al., 2024) and NAACL 2025 hypothesis-generation work: show
  behaviorally that temperature weakly raises novelty and that idea diversity saturates. We offer a mechanism and a quantitative
  law (Arrhenius slopes = internal utility gaps; top-k ceiling) that explains why.
- >-
  Intent Factored Generation (Ahmed et al., ICML 2025), String Seed of Thought (Sakana, ICLR 2026), Verbalized Sampling (2025):
  prompt-level two-stage or seed-based diversity methods. They act externally. Our Phase-5 intervention is an internal equivalent
  at the commitment point, and our seed analysis predicts WHEN naive seeding works (sigma_seed vs gap) instead of engineering
  around it.
- >-
  Emergent Response Planning in LLMs (arXiv 2502.06258): probes on the prompt representation predict response attributes.
  We go beyond decodability to a causal, idea-level utility vector at the commitment token whose geometry predicts counterfactual
  (banned or seeded) behavior.
inspiration: >-
  Econometrics, specifically McFadden's random-utility discrete-choice theory, transferred at the METHODOLOGICAL level. In
  that framework each intervention maps to a distinct parameter: the logit scale parameter (temperature), random utility shocks
  (seeds), choice-set restriction with the IIA / Hausman-McFadden test and nested-logit substitution (bans), and attribute
  coefficients (a typicality penalty for 'be novel' instructions). The nests, normally specified by hand, are read off the
  model's own representation geometry. The red-bus/blue-bus problem is exactly the user's 'ban the top 5: edge or opposite
  side?' question. Physical chemistry supplied the Arrhenius plot, ln(rate) vs 1/T with slope = barrier, as the diagnostic
  separating single-barrier commitment (straight lines) from multi-pathway (entropic) commitment (curved lines, rank reversals).
  Ecology supplied the alpha/beta diversity partition (Hill numbers within vs between ideas), which formalizes the user's
  (a)/(b)/(c) '10 ideas x 1 phrasing vs 1 idea x 10 phrasings' question. Finally, the llm-creativity repo's empirical puzzles
  (seeds inert, bans create a new attractor, selection is the bottleneck) motivated looking for one internal object that predicts
  all three.

  definition: >-
    A choice model in which similar options substitute for each other more strongly. Here the similarity comes from cosine
    similarity between idea centroids in the model's activations, computed on unbanned runs.
- term: Arrhenius plot
  definition: >-
    A plot of log-odds (or log-rate) against 1/temperature. Straight lines mean one fixed barrier (here, a fixed internal
    utility gap); curvature means several competing pathways.
- term: Seed shock (sigma_seed)
  definition: >-
    How much irrelevant random context prepended to the prompt moves the internal utility vector, measured as its spread across
    seed strings. Seeding can only change the idea when this is comparable to the utility gap.
- term: Alpha/beta diversity (Hill numbers)
  definition: >-
    Ecological diversity split into within-group (phrasings within one idea) and between-group (number and evenness of distinct
    ideas) components.
- term: Outside-menu share
  definition: >-
    Fraction of correct solutions that fall into no known idea class: the operational measure of a genuinely novel solution.
summary: >-
  An LLM's choice of solution idea (BFS vs Dijkstra vs A*) is a discrete choice made at a few early commitment tokens, governed
  by an internal utility vector and idea geometry that can be read before generation. These predict that temperature only
  flattens and never reorders ideas, that seeds work only when their internal shock beats the utility gap, and that bans send
  probability to the banned idea's internal neighbours (an IIA violation) rather than toward novelty. Steering the utilities
  at the commitment point is then the real creativity knob.
alternates:
- title: Ideas form gradually, so heat can reorder
  hypothesis: >-
    Idea choice is NOT made at a single commitment token. It builds up over the first sentences or lines through many partially
    committing tokens, so an idea's probability is a sum over many paths. Raising temperature then systematically favours
    'entropic' ideas, those reachable through many low-probability routes such as generic search skeletons that drift into
    DFS or 'other', over 'energetic' ideas with one sharp high-probability path such as canonical Dijkstra. The result is
    curved Arrhenius plots and rank reversals at T>1 that are predicted by each idea's path multiplicity measured at low T.
  why_it_could_win: >-
    This wins if the forking-path analysis shows idea mass spread over many positions rather than one fork, which is plausible
    for chatty instruct models that write a plan before coding. Temperature would then be a weak but real reordering knob
    whose direction is predictable from path multiplicity rather than from a single utility gap.
- title: Bans push ideas to the far side
  hypothesis: >-
    Prohibiting the top ideas in the prompt suppresses the internal features they share with their neighbours. Probability
    therefore flows AWAY from the banned region of the idea manifold, to ideas on the opposite side such as Bellman-Ford or
    IDA* after banning BFS/Dijkstra/A*, not to the banned ideas' nearest neighbours. The displacement distance grows with
    how many features the banned ideas share, measured by Gemma Scope SAE latent overlap.
  why_it_could_win: >-
    This wins if the suppression signal the instruction creates (cf. Semantic Gravity Wells' 22.8-point suppression in successful
    cases) acts on shared features rather than on the specific idea token, so neighbours are suppressed along with the banned
    idea. That is likelier for larger bans (top-5) and for models with strong instruction following, and it would make bans
    a surprisingly effective novelty lever.
- title: Erase the menu, not the answer
  hypothesis: >-
    Novel, correct solutions are reachable in one pass by projecting the commitment-layer residual off the low-dimensional
    subspace spanned by the known-idea centroids (linear concept erasure of the 'menu'). The model then produces correct algorithms
    outside the menu (hybrids, unusual frontier policies) at several times the rate achieved by prompt bans, 'be novel' instructions
    or temperature, at matched correctness. Prompt bans fail because naming the banned ideas re-activates the menu subspace.
  why_it_could_win: >-
    This wins if the menu occupies a compact subspace whose removal leaves task understanding (graph traversal, correctness)
    intact, so the model falls back on less typical but still competent compositions. The main hypothesis's flattening steering
    would then only reshuffle probability within the menu, while erasure would be the real route to novelty.
- title: One shared 'unusualness' dial
  hypothesis: >-
    Novelty instructions ('make a fully novel algorithm never seen before') work through a single task-general typicality
    direction in the residual stream that penalizes each idea in proportion to its baseline log-frequency. A difference-in-means
    vector extracted from novelty vs plain prompts on OTHER tasks (sorting, string search) transfers to path search and moves
    probability toward low-frequency ideas monotonically with steering strength, with no prompt change at all.
  why_it_could_win: >-
    This wins if 'typicality' is represented as a frequency-like scalar the model reads off for any task (like the persona
    or confidence directions found elsewhere) rather than as idea-specific features. Creativity would then have a single portable
    internal knob, which the main hypothesis's task-specific utility readout does not provide; CreativityNeuro's failed activation-steering
    transfer is the evidence against it.

<strategy_domain_reasoning>
How the strategist established that researchers in this field reason, at the level of the field's principles and standards of evidence. Take it as the starting point for the concrete practice below — extend or correct it where your own reading disagrees, and say so when you do.

FIELD: mechanistic interpretability of LLMs, applied to a behavioural phenomenon: which solution idea a code model picks. The econometrics borrowed here (random-utility models, IIA) and the ecology (Hill numbers) are measurement tools; the bar the result is judged against is the interpretability one. Sources read: the AII mechanistic-interpretability handbook (its sources S3, S4, S5, S9, S10, S14, S19, S20, S23, S31); Bigelow et al., Forking Paths (arXiv 2412.07961) and its hidden-state follow-up (arXiv 2511.04527), which already shows hidden states predict the outcome distribution; and the README of DrejcPesjak/llm-creativity. That repo used one task and claude-sonnet-5 with uncontrolled decoding and n=25 per cell. Seeds gave 0/100 basin changes, the negative-memory ban sent 16/25 programs to SPFA, generate-then-select gave the widest spread, and escaping cost correctness (25/25 to 16/25 optimal). (1) PRINCIPLES. The field defines itself by goal, not method. Its venue prints a two-track bar: specific falsifiable hypotheses with an account of how the evidence does and does not support them, OR clear practical benefit over well-implemented baselines (S14). It takes as given that linear readouts of the residual stream (probes, difference-in-means, logit/tuned lens) are legitimate instruments. It still argues about whether decodable means used (S3: 98% probe AUROC next to a 53-point knowledge-action gap), whether SAE latents are canonical units (S10, S31: not better than neurons, and prompting beats SAE steering), and whether a single extracted mechanism is a property or a sample (S4, S23). (2) WHAT COUNTS AS CONVINCING. A causal intervention beats a correlation: patching or steering that changes behaviour, compared against a random-direction or random-position control of matched norm. A readout that predicts behaviour OUT OF SAMPLE beats in-sample decodability. Results reported as distributions across samples and seeds, not a single draw, are preferred. Declaring the readout's function class matters, because unconstrained alignment maps fit anything (S5). (3) STANDARD MOVES AND WHAT THEY RULE OUT. Random-direction or random-position controls rule out 'any perturbation of that size does this'. A prompting baseline rules out 'steering only re-implements an instruction' (S31). Probes against a shuffled-label or control-task baseline rule out probe expressivity. Logit lens cross-checked with a trained probe or tuned lens rules out early-layer lens miscalibration, which is common in small models. Per-sample effect distributions rule out a mean that hides breakage (S20). Held-out tasks for any fitted parameter rule out overfitting a choice model to the cell it was fitted on. Forking-path resampling rules out reading commitment off a single greedy path (Bigelow). (4) USUAL FAILURE MODES. The behavioural label drifts from the construct; here the idea classifier is the measure, and the repo's rule and LLM classifiers agreed on only 164/200. Probes decode prompt identity instead of the upcoming choice. Steering is called creative when it just breaks code, so correctness must be matched. The temperature baseline is never tuned, which flatters the method. Claims rest on one model, one seed or one task. A 'novel' or 'other' bucket that is really garbage output. And a screen that crowns whichever candidate looks best after the fact.

<domain_practice>
FIRST WORK OUT HOW THIS KIND OF STUDY IS ACTUALLY BUILT IN THIS FIELD. Then
write the plan.

The strategy already settled what the field believes and what it counts as
convincing. Your job is the level below that: how work of exactly this kind
is designed, run and reported by the people who do it, concretely enough that
the executor's output would be recognised as competent by one of them.

Establish, for this field and this artifact type:

- BASELINES AND COMPARISONS. Which comparisons appear in every paper of this
  kind, named specifically. Which one would a reviewer name first if it were
  missing, and what is the standard way of tuning it fairly?
- CASES AND DATA. Which datasets, corpora, cohorts, benchmarks, case sets or
  sources are standard here, and which are known to be saturated, leaked,
  deprecated or unrepresentative. Prefer the ones the field actually uses,
  and say why when you pick something else.
- CONTROLS AND WHAT IS HELD CONSTANT. What has to be held fixed for the
  comparison to mean anything, and which confound this design is most likely
  to be caught on.
- HOW MUCH IS ENOUGH. Sample sizes, item counts, seeds, repeats, splits —
  the number below which nobody in this field believes a result, and what the
  field reports alongside a point estimate (variance, intervals, a
  significance or uncertainty treatment). When a power analysis, or the
  effect sizes already on record, say the panel cannot detect the size of
  effect the plan is chasing, the fix is more graded samples or checkpoints
  — not more candidate metrics. An underpowered panel stays underpowered no
  matter how many readouts run over it.
- MEASURES AND REPORTING CONVENTIONS. Which measures are standard, how they
  are computed here, and the conventions a reader will expect to see — what
  is reported, against what, in what form.

Not every axis applies to every artifact type: a proof has proof standards
and an accepted level of rigour rather than sample sizes, a research artifact
has source quality and coverage, a dataset has provenance, licensing and
documentation norms. Answer the ones that apply and skip the ones that do not
rather than inventing content for them.

HOW MUCH EFFORT. Bounded, like the strategist's: the fitting domain handbook
plus a handful of targeted lookups — one or two recent papers doing this exact
kind of study, a benchmark or dataset card, a methods or reproducibility note.
Read what the field does; do not reason it out from first principles. You
cannot run code, so this is reading only.

THEN CHECK THE PLAN AGAINST IT.
- `domain_practice`: what you established above, concretely — named baselines,
  named data, the numbers, the measures, with what you read.
- `practice_alignment`: go through the plan you just wrote against that list
  and say, point by point, where it MEETS the field's practice and where it
  DEPARTS from it. For every departure: why it is justified here (budget,
  scope, the claim being narrower) and what it costs the result's
  credibility. A departure nobody named is the one a reviewer finds.
- Where the check exposes a gap you can close inside the budget, close it in
  the plan rather than reporting it. `practice_alignment` is for what remains
  after you have fixed what you can.

<artifact_direction>
Make this direction concrete and actionable. Keep the same type and respect dependencies.

id: experiment_iter1_dir3
type: experiment
objective: >-
  INFLUENCE ARM. Screen three internal 'creativity knobs' against the knobs practitioners use, at matched correctness. (H)
  Flattening the idea-utility vector at the commitment layer. (A3) Projecting the residual off the subspace spanned by the
  menu-idea centroids (menu erasure). (A4) A task-general 'unusualness' direction extracted from novelty vs plain prompts
  on OTHER tasks and transferred to path search. The question is which, if any, produces more distinct and more genuinely
  novel correct solutions than temperature, novelty prompts and bans.
approach: >-
  Use the SHARED PROTOCOL exactly as in the other arms: model Qwen/Qwen2.5-3B-Instruct, prompts T1/T2/T3 verbatim, per-sample
  seed = index, max_tokens 768, the same taxonomy, AST/keyword classifier and execution oracle. RESERVED, DO NOT TOUCH: gemma-2-2b-it
  and any selection/k-th-smallest task. Primary test tasks: T1 (open menu) and T3 (canonical Dijkstra attractor). T2 is used
  only for the A4 extraction set. STEPS. (1) Baseline at T=0.7, n=300 on T1 and T3. Cache the residual at all layers, at the
  prompt-final token and over the first 32 generated tokens. Choose the intervention layer band (3 consecutive layers) by
  5-fold-CV multinomial-probe accuracy for the final idea at the prompt-final token, plus the first 8 generated tokens, with
  a shuffled-label control. This arm cannot wait for the temperature arm, so it locates its own layer and reports the probe
  curve. (2) Interventions, applied with forward hooks at the chosen layer band over the prompt-final token and the first
  32 generated positions, each swept over 5 strengths. (H-flatten): with the probe weights W (ideas x d), add alpha*(mean_j
  w_j - w_mode)*scale, pushing the residual toward equal idea logits. Equivalently, steer against the mode-vs-rest difference-in-means
  direction; report both variants. (A3-erase): project out the span of the k menu-idea centroids (global mean subtracted,
  k = number of ideas with >=3% share; rank also swept 1..k), with full and partial (alpha in [0,1]) erasure, in the style
  of LEACE/INLP linear concept erasure. (A4-dial): a difference-in-means direction between 'Make a fully novel algorithm never
  seen before' and plain prompts, at the prompt-final token. It is extracted ONLY on non-path tasks (sorting, substring search,
  primality testing, string reversal/compression, matrix multiplication; 40 prompt variants each), then added to plain path-search
  prompts with alpha swept. Its monotone dose-response is checked against baseline log-frequency (the A4 claim is that rare
  ideas gain in proportion to -log base rate). CONTROLS: random directions of matched norm (3 draws) and random rank-k projections,
  at the same layers and strengths. BASELINES, each tuned rather than taken at one setting: temperature T in {0.7, 1.0, 1.3,
  1.6, 2.0}; the prompts 'Make a new algorithm' and 'Make a fully novel algorithm never seen before... (2000 words)'; ban-top-3
  at T=0.7; and a generate-then-select prompt pipeline (list 10 approaches, pick one by an external RNG, implement it), the
  repo's best external method. n=100 per setting per task, scaled mini to full. (3) Metrics per setting: idea entropy (bits)
  over all classes; pass rate on the oracle; OUTSIDE-MENU CORRECT SHARE, meaning programs that pass the oracle, fall outside
  every known class, AND are confirmed by a cheap OpenRouter LLM judge (<= $1.5 total, track usage.cost; stop on any budget
  403) as a genuinely distinct algorithm rather than a renamed known one; and per-sample degeneration (empty, looping, non-code).
  Draw Pareto fronts of entropy vs pass rate and outside-menu share vs pass rate for every method, and report the per-sample
  distributions, not only the means. (4) Cheap mechanistic side check: for the best H-flatten setting, report whether the
  probe-read u actually flattens (a manipulation check). For A3, report whether the probe accuracy drops to chance after erasure
  (an erasure check) while pass rate holds. PRE-REGISTERED SELECTION RULE, at the matched operating point of pass rate >=
  80% of the baseline pass rate. H-flatten SURVIVES if its idea entropy is >= 2x that of the best tuned temperature at that
  pass rate, and it beats its random-direction control by a bootstrap CI that excludes 0. A3 SURVIVES if its outside-menu
  correct share is >= 3x that of the best of temperature, the novelty prompts and the bans, AND >= 5 percentage points absolute,
  beating random-projection controls. A4 SURVIVES if its dose-response is monotone (Spearman >= 0.8 over alpha) on BOTH T1
  and T3 after cross-task extraction, AND it beats its random-direction control. Rank all methods, including generate-then-select,
  on both Pareto fronts. If no internal knob beats the best prompt baseline, report that honestly as the 'prompting ceiling'
  result. OUTPUTS to keep: the steering vectors, probe weights, the A4 direction, all generations with labels, and the judge
  verdicts.

<build_on_prior_work>
BUILD ON WHAT THE EARLIER ROUNDS ALREADY PRODUCED. That is the default, not an option.

<prior_work> lists what this run has already built. Before planning anything
from scratch, go through it and find what this artifact can stand on:
- data that is already collected, cleaned, split or labelled
- models, fits, checkpoints or indexes that are already trained or built
- harnesses, scripts and evaluation code that already run
- the findings themselves, the NEGATIVE ones included — a condition already
  ruled out is a result to build past, not ground to cover again

Then say in `builds_on`, concretely, what this plan reuses: which artifact
and which file. The executor receives files only from the direction's declared
dependencies — nothing else is staged where it runs, and earlier workspaces
may already be purged — so a plan reuses ONLY those. An earlier artifact that
would help but is not a declared dependency is named in `builds_on` as not
available to this artifact, and the plan rebuilds what it needs from it; never
point the executor at another artifact's workspace path.

STARTING A FRESH LINE is allowed on exactly two grounds:
1. The iteration's move is a WIDEN — the run deliberately went back to the
   original ask to screen different candidate answers, so a new line is the
   point of the round.
2. The line this would have continued is a SETTLED NEGATIVE — already tested
   well enough that pushing it further buys nothing.
On either ground, `builds_on` says which one it is and why, and still names
whatever infrastructure (data, harness, code) the new line can reuse.

"Cleaner to start over" is not one of the two grounds. Neither is a plan that
simply does not mention the earlier rounds.
</build_on_prior_work>

<own_your_inputs>
A STEP THIS PLAN COMMISSIONS MUST HAVE ITS INPUTS OWNED BY SOMETHING SCHEDULED.

If this plan pre-registers a later phase — a held-out confirmation, a blind
set, a second pass, a replication — that phase needs inputs of its own:
labels, ground truth, an annotation pass, a scored reference. Before writing
that phase into the plan, name what produces those inputs and where that
production is scheduled: inside this artifact's own steps, or as one of the
direction's declared dependencies. Say it concretely, not "labels will be
added" — which task, at which point in the plan.

A later step whose inputs nobody is scheduled to produce is not a plan for
that step, it is a plan to skip it while looking like it was included.
</own_your_inputs>



<instructions>
YOUR ROLE: Write a detailed PLAN for the artifact. A separate executor agent runs the actual artifact later.

You are a PLANNER, not an executor. Your output is a plan that tells the executor what to do and how.
Do NOT execute the artifact itself — a separate agent handles that. Your job is to plan it so well that the executor can follow your plan step by step.

You CAN and SHOULD: search the web, read papers, and explore library docs to make your plan concrete.
You CANNOT run shell commands or scripts — code execution is disabled. Research via web tools only.

Do NOT do the executor's job: don't download datasets, don't implement code, don't run experiments, don't write proofs, don't compute evaluations.

<artifact_executor_scope>
IMPORTANT: Each artifact executor has a focused prompt that guides it to do ONE thing well. It will NOT perform tasks outside its scope — assigning the wrong work to the wrong artifact type wastes an iteration. Match the task to the right executor.

EXPERIMENT executor scope:
  Output: method_out.json with results (metrics, predictions, analysis) — the core computational work
  DOES: Implement and run methods/algorithms, compute metrics, compare approaches, produce quantitative results
  DOES NOT: Collect new datasets (depends on DATASET artifacts for input data), write formal proofs
  This is the right artifact for any code that processes data and produces results
</artifact_executor_scope>

<artifact_planning_rules>
EXPERIMENT: Must depend on at least one DATASET from the pool once the pool has one. A dependency can only name an artifact that already exists, so while the pool has no DATASET (usually the first iteration) the experiment either gets its own data or waits a round for the DATASET planned now. Define clear metrics and baselines before running. Consider trying multiple method variations rather than a single approach.
</artifact_planning_rules>

<compute_profiles>
Choose the compute profile this artifact needs for execution.
Available profiles for experiment artifacts:
  - gpu_basic: 1x NVIDIA RTX A4500, 20GB VRAM, 7 vCPUs, 29GB RAM — ML training, CUDA, large models (fallback: GPUs cheap→expensive: 2000 Ada → A4000 → 4000 Ada → L4 → PRO 4000 → PRO 4500 → 4090 → 5090)
  - cpu_plus: 4 vCPUs, 32GB RAM — large datasets, memory-intensive processing (fallback: CPUs cheap→expensive, then GPU hosts cheap→expensive (all ≥32GB RAM))

Set runpod_compute_profile to one of these exact tier names.
</compute_profiles>
GOOD PLANS: specific, actionable, consider failure scenarios, build on the suggested approach.
BAD PLANS: vague hand-waving, ignoring the suggested approach, missing critical executor details.

IMPORTANT: this task is NOT complete until `./.terminal_claude_agent_struct_out.json` exists and contains JSON matching the schema above.

take this repo as inspiration: https://github.com/DrejcPesjak/llm-creativity
use one or more open-weight models (minimum 1B params), probably instruction tuned it
and first run behavioral analysis (similar to repo mentioned above), then move to interpretability (can be manifolds, or also other techniques like sae, circuits, nla, j-lens, logit lens...)
the question is: how does "creativity" manifest inside the model, and can we influence it?
(in layman terms, can we make llms give truly creative and novel solutions?)

(you do not need to implement everything bellow, see whats reasonable, interesting and might lead to new insights)
is "temp" really the "llm creativity knob"?  (Astra found "coincidentally" similar direction for navier-stokes solution, as Buckmaster & Levent)
(always same seed)
a) does a tight temp , with topk=10 produce 10 reasoning trajectories of 1 idea/solution but same 10 phrasings
b) or does tight temp, with topk=10 produce 10 reasoning trajectories of 10 ideas/solutions with 1 phrasing each
c) and does loosing up temp, make a) more to 2/3/4 ideas each with 10 phrasings ; or make b) keep original 10 ideas, now each with 10 phrasings
test: "implement path saerch algorithm" -> does llm always design BFS?
can context seeding help? prepand "seed=d32qxk4nt43" or "seed=(horse chair roof love)"
is llm a probablistic model, and thus gives you the average/mean answer? and only context pushes you into a different subspace
 - ie of possible range of answer [0,100] , on direct question llm gives you 50. then with context you move to [80,100] subspace and llm gives you 90
so how much does prompt instructions matter? ("Make a new algorithm", "Make a fully novel algorithm never seen before ... 2000 words ..."

# Mechanistic interpretability — field handbook

## Overview

Scope: the FIELD of mechanistic interpretability — what a mechanistic claim is, how it is
validated, and where the frontier sits mid-2026. The star is the SUBSTRATE below: a dated,
source-anchored map with an explicit do-not-redo list. The only lens is open questions.
This is the SOLE interpretability handbook: SAE-era decomposition
primitives are covered here as one thread of six rather than in a separate deep-dive.

## Organizing principles (how the field reasons)

- The field defines itself by **goal, not method**: understand computational mechanisms "in order
  to accomplish concrete scientific and engineering goals" [S1].
- Its own venue prints a **two-track evidence bar**: either "specific falsifiable hypotheses, and
  how the evidence provided does and does not support them", or "clear practical benefits over
  well-implemented baselines" [S14].
- One methodological critique reframes findings as **statistical estimates, not properties**: the
  causal effect of a component is "a volatile random variable rather than a fixed property" [S4].
- **Structure is not mechanism.** Discovery algorithms "sample from an equivalence class of valid
  subgraphs rather than recovering a unique mechanism" [S23].
- **Causal abstraction is vacuous without an encoding assumption**: with unrestricted alignment maps,
  "any neural network can be mapped to any algorithm" [S5].
- The artifact a reader gets is a **hypothesis about the model, not a description of it** —
  attribution graphs (Anthropic) run on a replacement model and give satisfying insight on about
  "a quarter of the prompts" [S11].

## Frontier (recency-weighted)

**Validity & stability of the method itself** *(weight-capped — the loudest thread)*

- Circuit discovery is unstable under small perturbations: "small perturbations in input data
  or hyperparameters yield vastly different circuits" [S4] (2025-10, rev 2026-05).
- Phantom specialization: across 75 circuits in five Pythia models, structural differences showed
  "apparent specialization but do not correspond to functional differences" [S23] (2026-06).
- The workhorse approximation was diagnosed — attribution patching's "dominant error stems from the
  non-linearities in the downstream network rather than local curvature at the patched component",
  with a correction in the same paper [S19] (2026-06).

**Intrinsic interpretability (train-for-interpretability)**

- Weight-sparse transformers yield understandable circuits, but "making weights sparser trades off
  capability for interpretability", and "scaling sparse models beyond tens of millions of nonzero
  parameters while preserving interpretability remains a challenge" [S18] (2025-11).
- The newest entrant flips the unit from behavior to parameter, asking "whether a single weight can
  be understood globally across the full training distribution" [S2] (2026-07, four models only).

**Evaluation & standardization**

- MIB is a standardized method-comparison benchmark: on causal variable localization "the supervised DAS method
  performs best, while SAE features are not better than neurons" [S10] (ICML 2025), extended to a
  community shared task whose framing admission stands — "measuring progress in MI remains
  challenging" [S22] (BlackboxNLP 2025).
- Randomized baselines invalidate the auto-interp proxy: SAEs on randomly initialized transformers
  score similarly to trained ones [S9] (2025-01, rev 2026-01).

**Decomposition primitives (the SAE era, and after)**

- The sparsity objective is itself a distorting inductive bias: feature absorption "is caused by
  optimizing for sparsity in SAEs whenever the underlying features form a hierarchy", so
  "SAE latents may be inherently unreliable classifiers" [S30] (NeurIPS 2025 Oral).
- The single latent is not a canonical unit — SAE stitching shows dictionaries are incomplete and
  meta-SAEs show they are "not atomic" [S33] (ICLR 2025); seed-unstable latents concentrate in
  "reproducible lower-rank subspaces", i.e. basis ambiguity rather than noise [S35] (2026-06).
- The raw-latent verdict a reviewer will cite: on steering "prompting outperforms all existing
  methods" and on detection difference-in-means wins — "SAEs are not competitive" [S31] (2025-01);
  contested, but only by an unreviewed supervised-pipeline rebuttal [S25].
- Proxy metrics are the field's own named weak point: "gains on proxy metrics do not reliably
  translate to better practical performance" [S32] (ICML 2025).
- Model diffing has a known-bad default: the crosscoder L1 loss "can misattribute concepts as unique
  to the fine-tuned model, when they really exist in both models"; the same paper ships the BatchTopK
  fix [S34] (NeurIPS 2025).
- The flagship open fleet has already moved past SAE-only — Gemma Scope 2 ships "transcoders,
  cross-layer transcoders, and crosscoders" alongside SAEs [S36] (2025-12).

**Reasoning-trace interpretability**

- Faithfulness and monitorability come apart: "models can appear faithful yet remain hard to
  monitor when they leave out key factors" [S12] (2025-10).
- The dominant unfaithfulness metric is contested — it "confuses unfaithfulness with
  incompleteness", and "the absence of hint words alone does not prove unfaithfulness" [S13]
  (2025-12, rev 2026-05).

**Applied / safety-facing interpretability**

- Persona vectors (Anthropic) predict and pre-empt training-induced trait shifts, and "flag training data that
  will produce undesirable personality changes" [S16] (2025-07) — the clearest applied win.
- A blinded audit protocol exists: three of four teams "successfully uncovered the model's hidden
  objective", SAEs among the techniques used [S17] (2025-03).
- Counter-current, and the sharpest 2026 negative result — internal decodability far exceeded output
  behaviour: "Linear probes discriminated hazardous from benign cases with 98.2% AUROC, yet the
  model's output sensitivity was only 45.1%, a 53-percentage-point knowledge-action gap." SAE
  feature steering "produced zero effect despite 3,695 significant features", and steering was
  "indistinguishable from random perturbation" [S3] (2026-03; 400 physician-adjudicated vignettes,
  one clinical domain).

**Field strategy & meta-science**

- A frontier lab publicly narrowed its bet — "We have been disappointed by the amount of progress
  made by ambitious mech interp work, from both us and others", and "We made a decision to
  deprioritise SAE research as a result, not because we thought the technique was useless" [S6]
  (2025-12). One team's decision, not a field verdict.
- Results are not yet comparable across papers: two studies reached "conflicting conclusions for the
  same behavior", a third found both "partially correct but incomparable" [S8] (2026-04).

## Recent (~1–2 yr, compressed) · Durable core

- The field's own review concedes "there are many open problems in the field that require solutions
  before many scientific and practical benefits can be realized" [S1] (2025-01), and the LRM sub-map
  names the same gaps [S24]. The two framings a reviewer will invoke: "the returns from
  interpretability have been roughly nonexistent" [S7] (2025-05), against "We are thus in a race
  between interpretability and model intelligence." [S15] (2025-04) — a stated goal, not a result.
- Durable: activation patching remains the gold-standard causal metric faster methods approximate [S19];
  attribution graphs remain the scaling story, with their stated ceiling [S11].

## ⛔ Already crowded — go ELSEWHERE (do-not-redo)

The blank space is NOT in these lanes; each is saturated through H1-2026:

- **Circuit-discovery methods and their corrections.** Attribution patching, its error diagnosis and
  second-order fix [S19], structural-vs-functional decoupling [S23], and an eight-method community
  bake-off [S22] are all published.
- **Auto-interp / agentic feature explanation.** Both the agentic pipeline [S21] and the
  randomized-baseline invalidation of its metrics [S9] already exist.
- **Activation steering and its reliability diagnostics.** Per-sample unreliability and the
  linear-approximation limit are characterized [S20]; the AxBench verdict
  already has a published rebuttal [S25].
- **CoT faithfulness / monitorability metrics.** The measurement wave [S12] and the
  metric-invalidating counter-wave [S13] have both landed.
- **Benchmarking MI methods against each other.** MIB [S10] plus its shared-task extension [S22]
  own this; a new leaderboard re-treads it.
- **Developmental / training-dynamics interpretability.** Feature evolution is already tracked
  across pre-training snapshots with crosscoders [S28] (ICLR 2026).
- **Training-data attribution as an interpretability method.** Already explicitly bridged to MI and
  causally validated on Pythia [S26].
- **Multimodal / vision-language mechanistic interpretability.** Has its own survey and taxonomy
  since 2025-02 [S27].
- **Mechanistic interpretability of RL-trained reasoning models.** Occupied through 2026 — temporal
  sparse autoencoders already track feature dynamics across RLVR training [S29].
- **Sparse-dictionary decomposition of activations.** The most-worked lane in the field: SAE features
  are "not better than neurons" on MIB [S10], the auto-interp metrics used to defend them fail a
  randomized baseline [S9], absorption is traced to the objective itself [S30], canonical-unit claims
  are refuted [S33], and the raw-latent steering/detection verdict plus its rebuttal are both
  published [S31] [S25].

> **Standing directive — this list is necessarily INCOMPLETE.** Map-silence means *not-yet-checked*,
> NOT *open*. Before committing to any direction this map does not explicitly flag as crowded, run
> a fresh, dated saturation search and confirm the space is actually unoccupied. (Measured in this forge's own
> A/B runs: a live-searching baseline beats a static handbook precisely on the crowded lanes a
> map omits.)

## Open questions the field hasn't answered

*(the whole lens — the reader answers in their own way)*

1. If exact single-input causal scores are volatile random variables [S4] and structurally distinct
   circuits implement one computation [S23], **what object is circuit discovery actually estimating,
   and at what granularity is a "mechanism" even well-defined?** The field's standard output — one
   circuit, one figure — presupposes an answer it has not given.
2. Causal abstraction is vacuous without a constraint on how models encode information [S5]. What
   would make such an encoding assumption testable independently of the claim it licenses?
3. Near-perfect internal decodability coexists with a large knowledge-action gap and steering
   indistinguishable from random perturbation [S3]. What would have to hold for "we understand it"
   to imply "we can change it" — and is that implication load-bearing for the field's stated
   goals [S1]?
4. Two verdicts clash: the returns are "roughly nonexistent" [S7], yet the same window produced
   deployed applied results [S16] [S17]. On what measure are both true, and which should a paper
   report?
5. Two studies reached conflicting conclusions on one behavior and a third found both partially
   right but incomparable [S8]. What makes two mechanistic findings comparable at all, and can that
   be settled without a standard the field does not yet have?
6. Interpretability is bought at a stated capability cost with a scaling ceiling [S18], while
   auto-interp scores fail to separate trained from random networks [S9]. What is the exchange rate
   between understandability and capability, and who should be willing to pay it?

## What counts as DEEP here (taste)

| Naive move | Expert judgment/move | Why (failure prevented) | tier | src |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Ship a new circuit/feature method that improves a proxy metric on one task. | The rewarded move meets the venue's own bar: state "specific falsifiable hypotheses, and how the evidence provided does and does not support them", or show "clear practical benefits over well-implemented baselines". Recognition signal: a NeurIPS 2025 **Spotlight** went to a result proving the field's own framework vacuous when generalized [S5]. | problematizes-nothing — proxy-metric progress reads incremental in 2026 | L·A | [S14] [S5] |
| Treat a high auto-interpretability or reconstruction score as evidence that real features were recovered. | **Buried (2025-01, rev 2026-01):** the same scores appear on randomly initialized transformers [S9]. Reopening condition, stated there: routine randomized baselines plus targeted measures of feature abstractness. | wrong-result — the metric does not discriminate the thing it is used to claim | L | [S9] |
| Report one circuit, from one extraction, one seed, one input distribution, as *the* mechanism. | **Buried (2025-10 → 2026-06):** effects are volatile random variables [S4]; structure-to-function is many-to-one [S23]. Reopening condition: edge-level evaluation plus cross-condition transfer tests. | wrong-result — a single-draw circuit is an unreported sample from an equivalence class | L | [S4] [S23] |

> **Science-vs-application, as this field draws it:** unusually, it prints BOTH bars in one
> sentence [S14] — a falsifiable mechanistic claim, or a demonstrated practical benefit over strong
> baselines. What clears neither is a method with a better proxy score and no falsifiable
> hypothesis attached [S9] [S22].

## Critical rules (execution · eval · validity)

| Naive move | Expert judgment/move | Why (failure prevented) | tier | src |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Report a circuit from one seed/hyperparameter/input set. | Designing the run: sample across seeds, hyperparameters and input distributions; report the distribution and stability metrics, not the modal circuit. | wrong-result — single-config circuits are unstable | L | [S4] |
| Read structural difference between two circuits as two mechanisms. | Before claiming distinct mechanisms: run edge-level evaluation and cross-condition transfer; source-level evaluation inflates apparent faithfulness. | wrong-result — phantom specialization | L | [S23] |
| Use attribution patching scores as ground truth at scale. | When approximating: screen with a reliability score and correct the leading term; expect downstream non-linearity, not local curvature, to dominate the error. | wrong-result — the evidence for the circuit is itself misspecified | L | [S19] |
| Validate an interpretation with a freely-parameterized alignment map. | Stating the claim: fix and declare the map class, and make the encoding assumption explicit — unconstrained maps hit 100% interchange-intervention accuracy on randomly initialized models. | wrong-result — a perfect fit that means nothing | L | [S5] |
| Use a raw SAE latent as a classifier or steering target. | Choosing the unit: benchmark against difference-in-means and a prompting ceiling before claiming a latent works; expect absorption to make single latents unreliable where features are hierarchical. | wrong-result — the raw-latent verdict is the field's default prior | L | [S31] [S30] |
| Read a crosscoder model-diff at face value. | Diffing two models: use BatchTopK rather than L1 and presence-test any "unique to the fine-tune" latent — the artifact is a property of the loss. | wrong-result — the loss fabricates unique-to-finetune latents | L | [S34] |
| Score SAE/dictionary features against nothing. | Choosing the comparison: benchmark against non-featurized hidden vectors (neurons) and supervised DAS on MIB's tracks. | wrong-result — featurization may add zero | L | [S10] |
| Report auto-interp scores as the validity evidence. | Reporting: add a randomized-transformer arm; treat aggregate auto-interp as a proxy, never as recovery evidence. | wrong-result — untrained networks pass | L | [S9] |
| Claim a steering result from a mean effect at one coefficient. | Reporting steering: give the per-sample distribution and the behaviors where it fails; effect sizes "vary across samples and are unreliable for many target behaviors". | wrong-result — the mean hides the failure regime | L | [S20] |
| Call a CoT unfaithful because it omits a hint that changed the answer. | Judging traces: separate unfaithfulness from incompleteness, and pair hint-based metrics with causal mediation. | wrong-result — the metric over-reports | L | [S13] [S12] |
| Claim interpretability *enables* correction because the information is decodable. | Closing the loop: measure output-level correction AND collateral disruption of already-correct cases, against a random-perturbation control. | wrong-result — decodability ≠ actionability | L | [S3] |

## Decision guide

- **Which primitive for which question:** components and their interactions → circuit localization
  (attribution / mask optimization lead on MIB); an interpretable variable inside a hidden vector →
  causal variable localization (supervised DAS leads; SAE features do not beat neurons) [S10].
- **Post-hoc vs trained-for-interpretability:** post-hoc buys you the deployed model; weight-sparse
  training buys understandability at a capability cost and stops scaling in the tens of millions of
  nonzero parameters [S18].
- **Auditing claims:** in the reference blinded protocol, three of four teams succeeded, leaning on
  several technique families together rather than interpretability alone [S17].
- **Weighing sources:** most 2026 frontier results here are unreviewed preprints; the peer-reviewed
  anchors are [S5] (NeurIPS 2025 Spotlight), [S10] (ICML 2025), [S22] (BlackboxNLP 2025).

## Ground rules (known-lane — terse)

- Activation patching = the gold-standard causal metric; attribution patching = its first-order,
  gradient-based approximation, adopted for cost [S19].
- A "circuit" is a subgraph claimed to explain a behavior on a sub-distribution; the contrasting
  framing asks instead whether a single weight can be understood globally [S2].
- Attribution graphs are computed on a replacement model that "incompletely and imperfectly
  captures the original", so they yield hypotheses, not conclusions [S11].
- Interchange-intervention accuracy is a fit statistic, meaningful only relative to a declared map
  class [S5].
- Monitorability ≠ faithfulness: a trace can be faithful and still omit factors a monitor needs [S12].

## Reference documentation

- **[volatile.md](volatile.md)** — dated frontier numbers, lane-occupancy flags, and per-source
  review status. Re-check this FIRST before any novelty verdict or write-up.

## Candidate lane  ⚠️ (expert to resolve — NOT verified)

- ⚠️ **The crowded list is still not exhaustive.** Every lane flagged here has now been
  saturation-checked and ALL came back occupied (all are listed above). No flagged lane remains open.
  **Treat any lane this map does not mention as unchecked, not open, and search before committing —
  the measured base rate for unchecked lanes in this forge is 11/11 occupied.**
- ⚠️ **The actionability negative result [S3] is one clinical domain, one model family.** It is the
  strongest published statement of the knowledge-action gap, but generalization beyond triage
  vignettes is unverified. Confirm/refute: a replication in a non-clinical task with the same
  four-method comparison.
- ⚠️ **No peer-reviewed field-wide SURVEY was fetched** (a 2026 ACM Computing Surveys entry exists
  but was access-gated), and nothing independently confirms other labs made the same call as [S6].
  Individual claims are well-anchored — seven sources here are peer-reviewed — but a field-wide
  "the field holds X" statement still lacks a survey to rest on.
