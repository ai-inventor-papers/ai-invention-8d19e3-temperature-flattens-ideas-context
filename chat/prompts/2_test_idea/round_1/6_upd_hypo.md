<ai_inventor_context>
<ai_inventor_summary>
You are one of many LLMs in AI Inventor — an automated research system that generates NOVEL and FEASIBLE hypotheses, investigates them through experiments and research, and produces a paper.

Your output feeds other LLMs downstream. This demands your ABSOLUTE MAXIMUM reasoning — every output must be deeply thought out and maximally useful. Surface-level responses waste downstream computation.
</ai_inventor_summary>

<your_role>
YOU ARE: A hypothesis reviser (Step 3.6: UPD_HYPO in the invention loop)

You received the current hypothesis, all artifacts, and the run's research report.
Revise the hypothesis based on what the evidence supports.

Honest revision → focused research. Inflated confidence → wasted iteration.
</your_role>
</ai_inventor_context>

You are deciding where a research run points next, using the evidence it
gathered this iteration. Your revised hypothesis IS the next iteration's
hypothesis — nothing else steers the run — so this is a steering decision
first and a piece of honest reflection second.

SCOPE: Your ONLY output is the revised hypothesis text. You do NOT run code,
produce artifacts, fix bugs, or otherwise act on the evidence yourself — the
next iteration of the invention loop will spawn fresh artifacts based on your
revised hypothesis. Reflect on the evidence and rewrite the hypothesis;
nothing else.

PRINCIPLES:
- Ground every revision in specific artifacts and results. A number that was
  projected, assumed or left as a placeholder is not a result.
- CLASSIFY EVERY ARTIFACT SEPARATELY, BEFORE CHOOSING A MOVE. One artifact
  is one bet. A round is normally MIXED, and judging the round as a whole is
  how one real positive gets thrown out with the nulls beside it. The round
  summary is then READ OFF the best of those verdicts, and the move follows
  from the summary and the remaining budget by a fixed rule — not by free
  judgement, because free judgement is where past runs went wrong.
- LATCH ONTO A GENUINE POSITIVE. One executed, non-obvious, baseline-proof
  result at a size the ask cares about is the run's whole output. Hold it,
  and spend the next round on its mechanism, its boundary, its confounds and
  its replication. Do not go looking for a different question while it lives.
- WEAK IS NOT NULL. A small real effect, a positive that lost to a baseline
  by a margin, a signal seen on one body of evidence — these are LEADS. The
  answer to a lead is to make it bigger and cleaner, not to abandon it. Widen
  off a lead only after deepening it has come back empty.
- A round where NOTHING is real is the signal to go WIDER, not smaller. The
  question the user asked is still open; the answer you tried is the only
  thing that was refuted, and every next bet should be a different answer to
  the ask.
- Never shrink the claim until the effect you happened to observe becomes
  the claim. A finding nobody needed is worse than an honest negative.
- A broken test is fixed ONCE, with the claim unchanged. A bet that breaks
  twice is dropped, and its budget goes to a new candidate.
- The run is looking for a POSITIVE, NON-OBVIOUS result. A clean negative is
  a LAST RESORT, right only when no iteration and no candidate remain.
- Increase specificity as evidence accumulates; do not inflate confidence
  without strong evidence.
- Revise hypothesis text only — never attempt to address feedback by running
  code, proposing fixes, or producing artifacts; the next loop iteration
  handles all artifact generation.

<workspace>
Your workspace: `/ai-inventor/aii_data/runs/run_wfWEMjpWKygr/3_invention_loop/iter_1/upd_hypo/upd_hypo`

CRITICAL: Every file you create, write, or save MUST be inside this workspace directory (subdirectories OK). You MUST NOT write files anywhere outside this path — external paths are READ-ONLY. Use absolute paths for all file operations.

EVERY file write MUST start with `/ai-inventor/aii_data/runs/run_wfWEMjpWKygr/3_invention_loop/iter_1/upd_hypo/upd_hypo/`:
GOOD: `/ai-inventor/aii_data/runs/run_wfWEMjpWKygr/3_invention_loop/iter_1/upd_hypo/upd_hypo/file.py`, `/ai-inventor/aii_data/runs/run_wfWEMjpWKygr/3_invention_loop/iter_1/upd_hypo/upd_hypo/results/out.json`
BAD: `/tmp/file.py`, `~/output.json`, `./file.py`, any path outside the workspace
</workspace>
<disposable_outputs>
YOUR WORKING DIRECTORY IS A DELIVERABLE. When this module ends it must read
like a GitHub repository someone else can fork, resume and run — and the bulk
it holds must be either worth keeping or restorable. This run shares a storage
volume with the database; a run that fills it stops every other run on the box.

So before you finish, produce TWO files:

1. `.aii/manifest.yaml` — one entry per heavy path, each with EXACTLY ONE decision.
   The `.aii/` directory ALREADY EXISTS in your cwd: write the file into
   it. Do not create, replace or `touch` `.aii` itself — a plain file by
   that name makes the manifest unwritable for the rest of the module.

```yaml
entries:
  - path: results/
    keep: six GPU-hours of sweep output, not reproducible inside this run
  - path: hf_cache/
    delete: redownloadable
    source: "huggingface-cli download meta-llama/Llama-3-8B"
  - path: checkpoints/
    delete: regenerable
    source: "uv run train.py --epochs 3 --seed 0"
```

   - `keep:` takes a ONE-LINE reason. Use it for the expensive and the
     irreproducible: trained weights, long-running results, datasets you
     collected yourself.
   - `delete:` takes `redownloadable` (and a `source:` naming the repo id, URL
     or command) or `regenerable` (and a `source:` that is the command which
     rebuilds it). These are deleted AFTER the round ends, never mid-step.
   - Every path is RELATIVE TO YOUR CWD and must resolve INSIDE it. Absolute
     paths, `..`, and anything resolving outside are rejected.
   - Globs and whole directories are fine. A whole `hf_cache/` is ONE entry —
     do not list files individually.

2. `README.md` — written as if your cwd were a GitHub repository: what you
   did, the layout with a line per important file/directory, how to run it,
   and a **"Restoring removed files"** section giving the install/download
   command for EVERY `delete` entry. An `install.sh` or `restore.sh` beside it
   is welcome.

A CHECKER RUNS WHEN YOU SUBMIT. If anything heavy has no decision it fails
your submission and hands you the uncovered list, grouped by directory with
sizes, and you fix the manifest and submit again.

WHAT NEEDS NO DECISION — do not write entries for these:
- text and code files, at ANY size (source, JSON, CSV, YAML, logs, markdown);
- anything under the auto-keep floor (10 MB), whatever it holds.
Only large binaries and cache directories (`hf_cache/`, `.venv/`,
`node_modules/`, `checkpoints/`, `wandb/`, `__pycache__/`, …) need one.

NEVER mark your results, figures, papers, code, logs or anything a later step
reads as `delete`. If a later step needs it, it is a `keep`.

WHAT A `keep` BUYS YOU. Anything you do not mark `delete` stays exactly where
you wrote it, on this run's storage volume, at the path it already has — it is
not moved, renamed or copied. A later round reads it there, by that absolute
workspace path, so a checkpoint you keep is a checkpoint the next round can
load instead of retraining. It is also the ONLY copy: the publish step pushes
your cwd to GitHub but skips every file of 100 MB or
more, so trained weights and large binary artifacts never leave the volume.
Name each kept artifact in your results and your `README.md` by its path
RELATIVE to your cwd, and say it stays on the run's volume rather than in the
published repository. Never write an absolute server path into a file that is
published: a reader's machine has none of them.

The hypothesis as it stands. Revise it based on the evidence below.

kind: hypothesis
title: Temperature Flattens Ideas, Context Reorders Them
hypothesis: >-
  When an instruction-tuned open-weight LLM (>=1B parameters) is asked an open design task such as 'implement a path search
  algorithm', which solution idea it picks (BFS, DFS, Dijkstra, A*, bidirectional, ...) works like a discrete choice. That
  choice is made at a few early COMMITMENT TOKENS, and at those tokens the residual stream carries a readable IDEA-UTILITY
  VECTOR u: one score per candidate idea, read from the logits or the logit lens at the commitment position, or from a linear
  probe on the state just before it. This vector, together with the similarity geometry of the ideas' internal representations,
  PREDICTS BEFORE GENERATION what each 'creativity knob' will do. Each knob acts on a different parameter of one random-utility
  model. (1) TEMPERATURE only rescales u. Idea log-odds therefore fall on straight Arrhenius lines, ln[P_T(j)/P_T(mode)] ~
  -(u_mode - u_j)/T, with slopes equal to the internal utility gaps. Temperature can flatten the idea distribution but never
  reorder it, and phrasing diversity grows far faster than idea diversity: the user's case (a) '1 idea x many phrasings',
  and with top-k=10 a hard ceiling equal to the number of idea tokens inside the top-k at the commitment position. (2) RANDOM
  CONTEXT SEEDS ('seed=d32qxk4nt43', '(horse chair roof love)') act as random utility shocks with a measurable internal spread
  sigma_seed. They change the chosen idea only when sigma_seed is comparable to the utility gap, which explains why seeding
  fails on canonical tasks like weighted shortest path -> Dijkstra. (3) BANS restrict the choice set but break the independence
  of irrelevant alternatives (IIA): the banned idea's probability flows mainly to its nearest neighbours in the model's internal
  idea geometry, as in a nested logit, rather than to the remaining ideas in proportion to their base rates. 'Banning the
  attractor creates an adjacent attractor', e.g. Dijkstra -> SPFA. (4) NOVELTY INSTRUCTIONS shift u along a single typicality
  axis. The 'default answer' is therefore the MODE of the internal utility landscape, not an average of possible answers,
  and only interventions that change u (context, or direct steering at the commitment layer) can reorder ideas or reach ones
  outside the usual menu.
motivation: >-
  People reach for temperature as the 'creativity knob' and for 'be original'/'don't use X' prompts as the novelty lever.
  Behavioral studies, though, show that temperature mostly adds surface variation (Peeperkorn et al. 2024), that incidental
  cues swing algorithm choice by up to 100 percentage points with no mechanism identified (Invisible Lottery, 2026), and that
  banning the dominant solution simply produces a new dominant one: the DrejcPesjak/llm-creativity repo saw 16 of 25 programs
  collapse to SPFA under a ban list, while random seeds had zero effect. Nobody has a model that PREDICTS these outcomes,
  so practitioners tune knobs blindly. If idea choice is a readable discrete choice, one internal measurement (the utility
  vector and the idea geometry at the commitment token) tells you in advance: whether temperature can reach a new idea at
  a tolerable temperature (only if the gap is small), whether seeding will do anything (only if sigma_seed is comparable to
  the gap), and where a ban will send the model (to the banned idea's neighbour, not to something novel). It also says what
  WILL produce new ideas: acting on u directly at the commitment point. That turns the folk question 'is the LLM just giving
  me the average answer?' into a measurable claim (mode of a utility landscape, not a mean) and turns creativity control from
  prompt lore into a predictable intervention. It also directly answers the user's questions (a)/(b)/(c) about temperature
  and top-k, the seeding question, the 'average answer' question, and the 'ban the top-5: does mass move to the edge or the
  opposite side of the manifold?' question.
assumptions:
- >-
  For algorithm-design prompts, the idea is fixed within the first few dozen generated tokens, typically at an algorithm-name
  token in the preamble ('Here is an implementation of A*') or at a data-structure token (deque vs heapq vs a stack/recursion).
  Forking-path resampling (Bigelow et al. 2025) can locate this point, so a per-sample commitment position exists for most
  samples.
- >-
  Generated solutions can be classified reliably into idea classes with a deterministic AST/keyword classifier (deque+popleft
  -> BFS, heapq without a heuristic -> Dijkstra, heapq plus a heuristic -> A*, explicit stack or recursion -> DFS, repeated
  edge relaxation -> Bellman-Ford/SPFA, two frontiers -> bidirectional, otherwise 'other/novel'), checked by running the code
  on random graphs against an oracle, as in the llm-creativity repo.
- >-
  Mid-layer residual representations of the commitment window, meaning the mean over the commitment token plus the next ~16
  tokens, give a stable, seed-robust geometry of ideas (centroid cosine similarities). This geometry is computed ONLY from
  unbanned baseline runs, so it can predict substitution under bans out of sample.
- >-
  The instruction-tuned models used are not so mode-collapsed that the baseline menu has only one idea. At T=1, at least 3
  idea classes occur with >=3% frequency on at least 2 of the 3 tasks; this is checked in the first screening step, and tasks
  failing it are swapped.
- >-
  GPU inference is available for the experiment phase (a single 24-48 GB GPU via the aii-runpod skill; the local machine has
  2 CPU cores and no GPU). vLLM handles sampling and HuggingFace/TransformerLens with forward hooks handles activations. CPU
  fallback: Qwen2.5-1.5B-Instruct, outputs capped at 160 tokens (enough to classify the idea, since commitment is early),
  n=40 per cell.
investigation_approach: |-
  MODELS: Qwen2.5-3B-Instruct (primary) and gemma-2-2b-it (second family; has public Gemma Scope SAEs for feature-level naming). Llama-3.2-3B-Instruct is optional for replication. TASKS (3): T1 'Implement a path search algorithm in Python' (open menu), T2 'Implement a sorting algorithm' (large menu: quick/merge/heap/insertion/radix/counting/shell/...), T3 'Implement a function that finds a shortest path in a weighted graph' (the canonical Dijkstra attractor, as in the repo). Same base seed everywhere, as the user asked.

  PHASE 1, BEHAVIOR (the user's a/b/c questions). Grid: T in {0.3, 0.5, 0.7, 1.0, 1.3, 1.6} x top-k in {10, none}, n=100 samples per cell per task. Classify each sample's idea, run its code against an oracle on 50 random graphs/arrays, and measure phrasing diversity within each idea (normalized-code edit distance and embedding distance). Partition diversity ecologically: Hill numbers between ideas (beta) vs within ideas (alpha). This answers (a) vs (b) vs (c) directly. Conditions: baseline; 'Make a new algorithm'; 'Make a fully novel algorithm never seen before... 2000 words'; 3 random-character seeds and 3 random-word seeds x 30 seed strings each; bans of the top-1/top-3/top-5 baseline ideas; and a control ban of a rare idea (tests priming, cf. Semantic Gravity Wells). Bans run at T=0.7, n=100.

  PHASE 2, LOCATE THE CHOICE. For 60 baseline samples per task, run forking-path resampling: at each of the first 64 positions, resample 10 continuations and classify them. The commitment token is the first position after which the idea distribution stays fixed. Then test a probe and the logit lens: at each layer, does the residual stream at the commitment token, and at the prompt-final token, linearly predict the final idea? This gives the layer and position where the choice forms. Causal check: patch the commitment-token residual from a BFS run into a Dijkstra run at the identified layers and measure the idea flip rate (with a random-position patch as control).

  PHASE 3, READ THE CHOICE MODEL (all from baseline runs only). u = log-probabilities at the commitment position over each idea's identifying tokens, cross-checked with a multinomial probe on the pre-commitment residual. Geometry S = cosine similarity between idea centroids of commitment-window activations at the best probe layer. Draw the 'path-search algorithm manifold' the user asked for: PCA/UMAP of the activations, centroids sized by count, then the same plot after bans with arrows showing where mass moved.

  PHASE 4, PREDICT EVERY KNOB OUT OF SAMPLE. (i) Temperature: fit an Arrhenius line per idea and correlate its slope with the internal gap u_mode-u_j. Predicted top-k ceiling = the number of idea tokens in the top-k at commitment. Count rank reversals. (ii) Seeds: measure sigma_seed as the spread of u across seed prefixes. Predicted greedy flip rate = P(argmax changes under Gaussian shocks of size sigma_seed), compared with the observed rate on each task. (iii) Bans: compare three predictors of the post-ban idea distribution: IIA-proportional renormalization of the baseline; behavioral co-occurrence similarity; and a geometry nested logit P'(j) proportional to P(j) * (1 + lambda * sum_banned b of S_jb * P(b)), where lambda is fitted on one task and tested on the other two. Score them by Jensen-Shannon divergence and held-out log-likelihood. Edge vs opposite side: check whether post-ban mass sits closer in S to the banned centroids than the baseline-weighted average does. (iv) Novelty instructions: regress the shift in u on log baseline frequency to get a single 'typicality' slope.

  PHASE 5, INFLUENCE IT. At the commitment layer and position, add a steering vector built from the utility-probe weights that FLATTENS u (an internal version of 'generate the menu, then pick at random'). Also test projecting out the subspace spanned by the menu-idea centroids, which aims for ideas outside the menu. Compare against temperature, bans and seeds at matched pass rate on idea entropy, outside-menu share and correctness. Name the features involved with Gemma Scope SAE latents on gemma-2-2b-it (e.g. 'priority queue', 'level-order') and list which ones the steering moves.

  COST: roughly 20k generations of <=400 tokens (about 1-2 GPU-hours with vLLM on a 3B model) plus about 4k activation-cached forward passes and about 40k forking-path rollouts of 64 tokens (about 1-2 GPU-hours). No paid LLM calls are needed, since classification is rule-based with code execution.
success_criteria: >-
  CONFIRM if most of the following hold on both models. (1) Commitment is localized: for >=75% of samples the idea is fixed
  within the first 48 generated tokens, and patching the commitment-token residual flips the idea in >=50% of trials vs <10%
  for a random-position patch. (2) Temperature law: the Arrhenius fits ln-odds vs 1/T reach R^2>=0.85 for ideas with >=3%
  frequency at T=1; the slopes correlate with the internal gaps u_mode-u_j (Spearman >=0.7); there are no rank reversals among
  the top-3 ideas for T<=1.3; within-idea phrasing diversity rises >=3x more steeply with T than idea count; and with top-k=10
  the number of distinct ideas never exceeds the predicted ceiling. (3) Seeds: the shock model predicts the per-task flip
  rate within +/-0.10, and seeds are ineffective (<5% flips) exactly on tasks where gap/sigma_seed>3 (expected for T3). (4)
  Bans: the geometry nested logit beats IIA-proportional renormalization by >=20% lower Jensen-Shannon divergence on held-out
  tasks and bans; in >=70% of single bans the top substitute is the banned idea's nearest internal neighbour; and post-ban
  mass lies on the 'edge' (closer to the banned centroids than the baseline average is). (5) Influence: commitment-point flattening
  at least doubles idea entropy relative to the best temperature at equal pass rate (>=80% pass), while bans mostly reshuffle
  within the menu (outside-menu share <15%). DISCONFIRM / redirect: curved Arrhenius plots or rank reversals with rising T
  would mean commitment is spread over many tokens and ideas reachable by many paths gain at high T (alternate A1). Geometry
  predicting no better than IIA would mean bans redistribute proportionally (the choice set is unstructured). Post-ban mass
  moving AWAY from the banned centroids would mean ban-induced repulsion through shared features (alternate A3). Each of these
  is still an informative mechanistic finding about how the knobs act.

inspiration: >-
  Econometrics, specifically McFadden's random-utility discrete-choice theory, transferred at the METHODOLOGICAL level. In
  that framework each intervention maps to a distinct parameter: the logit scale parameter (temperature), random utility shocks
  (seeds), choice-set restriction with the IIA / Hausman-McFadden test and nested-logit substitution (bans), and attribute
  coefficients (a typicality penalty for 'be novel' instructions). The nests, normally specified by hand, are read off the
  model's own representation geometry. The red-bus/blue-bus problem is exactly the user's 'ban the top 5: edge or opposite
  side?' question. Physical chemistry supplied the Arrhenius plot, ln(rate) vs 1/T with slope = barrier, as the diagnostic
  separating single-barrier commitment (straight lines) from multi-pathway (entropic) commitment (curved lines, rank reversals).
  Ecology supplied the alpha/beta diversity partition (Hill numbers within vs between ideas), which formalizes the user's
  (a)/(b)/(c) '10 ideas x 1 phrasing vs 1 idea x 10 phrasings' question. Finally, the llm-creativity repo's empirical puzzles
  (seeds inert, bans create a new attractor, selection is the bottleneck) motivated looking for one internal object that predicts
  all three.

    Fraction of correct solutions that fall into no known idea class: the operational measure of a genuinely novel solution.
summary: >-
  An LLM's choice of solution idea (BFS vs Dijkstra vs A*) is a discrete choice made at a few early commitment tokens, governed
  by an internal utility vector and idea geometry that can be read before generation. These predict that temperature only
  flattens and never reorders ideas, that seeds work only when their internal shock beats the utility gap, and that bans send
  probability to the banned idea's internal neighbours (an IIA violation) rather than toward novelty. Steering the utilities
  at the commitment point is then the real creativity knob.
alternates:
- title: Ideas form gradually, so heat can reorder
  hypothesis: >-
    Idea choice is NOT made at a single commitment token. It builds up over the first sentences or lines through many partially
    committing tokens, so an idea's probability is a sum over many paths. Raising temperature then systematically favours
    'entropic' ideas, those reachable through many low-probability routes such as generic search skeletons that drift into
    DFS or 'other', over 'energetic' ideas with one sharp high-probability path such as canonical Dijkstra. The result is
    curved Arrhenius plots and rank reversals at T>1 that are predicted by each idea's path multiplicity measured at low T.
  why_it_could_win: >-
    This wins if the forking-path analysis shows idea mass spread over many positions rather than one fork, which is plausible
    for chatty instruct models that write a plan before coding. Temperature would then be a weak but real reordering knob
    whose direction is predictable from path multiplicity rather than from a single utility gap.
- title: Bans push ideas to the far side
  hypothesis: >-
    Prohibiting the top ideas in the prompt suppresses the internal features they share with their neighbours. Probability
    therefore flows AWAY from the banned region of the idea manifold, to ideas on the opposite side such as Bellman-Ford or
    IDA* after banning BFS/Dijkstra/A*, not to the banned ideas' nearest neighbours. The displacement distance grows with
    how many features the banned ideas share, measured by Gemma Scope SAE latent overlap.
  why_it_could_win: >-
    This wins if the suppression signal the instruction creates (cf. Semantic Gravity Wells' 22.8-point suppression in successful
    cases) acts on shared features rather than on the specific idea token, so neighbours are suppressed along with the banned
    idea. That is likelier for larger bans (top-5) and for models with strong instruction following, and it would make bans
    a surprisingly effective novelty lever.
- title: Erase the menu, not the answer
  hypothesis: >-
    Novel, correct solutions are reachable in one pass by projecting the commitment-layer residual off the low-dimensional
    subspace spanned by the known-idea centroids (linear concept erasure of the 'menu'). The model then produces correct algorithms
    outside the menu (hybrids, unusual frontier policies) at several times the rate achieved by prompt bans, 'be novel' instructions
    or temperature, at matched correctness. Prompt bans fail because naming the banned ideas re-activates the menu subspace.
  why_it_could_win: >-
    This wins if the menu occupies a compact subspace whose removal leaves task understanding (graph traversal, correctness)
    intact, so the model falls back on less typical but still competent compositions. The main hypothesis's flattening steering
    would then only reshuffle probability within the menu, while erasure would be the real route to novelty.
- title: One shared 'unusualness' dial
  hypothesis: >-
    Novelty instructions ('make a fully novel algorithm never seen before') work through a single task-general typicality
    direction in the residual stream that penalizes each idea in proportion to its baseline log-frequency. A difference-in-means
    vector extracted from novelty vs plain prompts on OTHER tasks (sorting, string search) transfers to path search and moves
    probability toward low-frequency ideas monotonically with steering strength, with no prompt change at all.
  why_it_could_win: >-
    This wins if 'typicality' is represented as a frequency-like scalar the model reads off for any task (like the persona
    or confidence directions found elsewhere) rather than as idea-specific features. Creativity would then have a single portable
    internal knob, which the main hypothesis's task-specific utility readout does not provide; CreativityNeuro's failed activation-steering
    transfer is the evidence against it.

<reviewer_feedback>
Feedback from the paper reviewer this iteration.

The previous review is BLOCKING: what it reviewed must not go forward as it stands. Every MUST-FIX item below is a requirement for this iteration, not a suggestion — an iteration that leaves one unaddressed does not publish.

- [MAJOR MUST-FIX] (evidence) Completeness: the ban arm (gen_art_experiment_2) is reported as having 'failed ... before producing results', but it produced 4,360 generations and labelled 4,210 of them (all but the co-mention lists). data/gen/{T1,T2,T3} contains baseline n=300, ban_r1..r4, ban_top3, ban_top5, ban_rare, placebo, para1_r1 and para2_r1 at n=100 each, forced_<idea> cells at n=10 and co-mention lists at n=50. data/labels/{T1,T2,T3} and logs/label.log carry the labels. Only the oracle (labels carry pass=0.00 because the no-oracle path was used), activation capture (ValueError: accelerate missing) and the analysis stage did not run. Recomputed from the label files: T1 ban_r1 (BFS) gives DFS 66, Other 15, A* 11, Dijkstra 7, BFS 1. T1 ban_top3 gives IDDFS 42, DFS 18, Dijkstra 16, A* 8, with 29/100 still banned. T1 ban_top5 gives IDDFS 42, A* 16, with 38/100 still banned. T2 ban_top3 gives Selection 55, Insertion 42, 0 still banned. T2 ban_top5 gives Counting 45, Heap 26. T3 ban_r1 (Dijkstra) gives Bellman-Ford 55, BFS 19, Dijkstra 12. T3 ban_top3 has 46/100 still banned and ban_top5 61/100. This is the run's only evidence on where banned probability goes, which is the user's 'move to the edge or the opposite side' question, and none of it is in the record.
  Action: Add a ban-arm section with the full per-condition count tables for all three tasks, entropy and still-banned counts, and the forced-idea and co-mention tables, each traced to data/labels/<T>/<cond>.jsonl and logs/label.log. Mark explicitly what did not run (oracle, activations, nested-logit and geometry fit) and why. In the next iteration, run the influence arm's audited AST classifier and oracle over these generations so the two arms share one label space.
- [MAJOR MUST-FIX] (evidence) Contradiction with the run's own evidence. Conclusion 5 ('Bans are mostly ignored by this 3B model (87% to 95%)'), the open item ('a 3B model may be the wrong place to test substitution structure, since there is little banned mass to redistribute') and the answer to question 7 ('the 3B model mostly ignored the ban') all generalise from one prompt protocol to the model. The ban arm, with the same model, T=0.7 and the same task sentence but no output contract and the wording 'Do not use X, Y or Z.', shows large compliance and structured near-neighbour substitution: BFS/DFS/A* banned leads to IDDFS; Dijkstra banned leads to Bellman-Ford; sorting top-3 banned leads to Selection/Insertion. Compliance also falls with list length on T3 (ban_r1 12% still banned, top-3 46%, top-5 61%), a pattern consistent with the 'naming primes' account [5] and worth recording.
  Action: Withdraw 'bans are mostly ignored by this model'. Replace it with: non-compliance is 87-95% under the contract prompt with list-style wording, and 0-46% under the bare prompt with short-list wording (61% for the T3 top-5 list). The difference is unexplained, and the contract and the ban wording are confounded. Reopen question 7 as 'partially answered: substitution goes to near neighbours (IDDFS for DFS/BFS, Bellman-Ford for Dijkstra) at the behavioural level; geometry not yet run'.
- [MAJOR MUST-FIX] (evidence) The temperature arm is described only as 'not delivered ... raw generations were not analysed'. data/raw_grid.jsonl holds 3,623 completed generations: the full 3 tasks x T{0.3,0.5,0.7,1.0,1.3,1.6} x top-k{10, none} x n=100 grid, plus greedy and repeat rows. data/raw_seeds.jsonl holds 360 seed-string generations (greedy and T=0.7, 60 per task). logs/chain.log shows GRID EXIT 0 and SEEDS EXIT 0, and only labelling was killed (EXIT 130). The report gives none of these paths or counts. It lists seeds as 'untested' rather than 'generated, unlabelled', and it omits two facts that matter for the user's 'always same seed' protocol: 51% of grid rows hit finish=length at 768 tokens (grid_stdout.log), and vLLM grid bit-reproducibility was 2/20 (data/repro_grid.json).
  Action: Record the arm's actual state, with paths, row counts, the 51% truncation rate and the 2/20 reproducibility. In the next iteration, label raw_grid.jsonl and raw_seeds.jsonl with an existing classifier (the influence arm's protocol/classifier.py, or the arm's own ideaclf with its 41/41 fixtures). Report idea share and Hill-number within/between-idea partitions per (task, T, top-k). This directly answers the user's questions a/b/c and the seeding question at essentially no GPU cost. Also check whether truncation biases labels at high T.
- [MAJOR MUST-FIX] (methodology) Unrecorded confound: the output contract defines the menu. The influence arm appends a function-signature contract (find_path on an unweighted adjacency dict; shortest_path returning (distance, path)). The user's prompt and the ban arm's prompt are the bare sentence. Bare-prompt T1 (ban arm) gives BFS 60%, DFS 15%, A* 13%, Dijkstra 7%, H = 1.764 bits. Contract T1 gives BFS 68%, DFS 27%, H = 1.145. Bare-prompt T3 gives heapq-Dijkstra 300/300, while contract T3 gives BFS-style relaxation 71/300 and heapq in only 219/300. The report's answer to question 2, the 'narrow-menu fallback', the rank-1 erasure, and the explanation of why flattening 'overshoots the uniform point and selects the minority idea' all rest on a two-idea menu that the contract appears to create. (The two arms' classifiers also differ, so part of the T3 gap could be labelling, which is itself unresolved.)
  Action: Add both baselines side by side in Section 1.4 and state that every influence-arm conclusion is conditional on the contract prompt. In iteration 2, rerun the baseline and the H-dim/A4 settings on the bare prompt, with code-only extraction for the oracle, so the selector finding is tested on a menu of four or more ideas, where 'flatten' and 'select' make different predictions.
- [MAJOR MUST-FIX] (novelty) The positive mechanistic claims have no nearest-neighbour comparison. Claim 1 says steering directions are selectors, not diversifiers, and claim 3 says matched-norm random directions raise idea entropy about as much as targeted ones. Close published neighbours: Tan et al. 2024 (arXiv 2407.12404, NeurIPS) on steering-vector unreliability and anti-steerability; Turner et al. 2023 [7], whose matched-norm random-vector control barely changed outputs; 'Steering LLMs to Evaluate and Amplify Creativity' (arXiv 2412.06060), which reports a creativity direction that increases diversity; and STARS / Stiefel activation steering (arXiv 2601.22010, ICLR 2026) plus Riemannian activation steering for diverse reasoning (arXiv 2511.08305), which report diversity gains over sampling. The run's random-control parity result conflicts with some of these and would be a contribution only once that comparison is written down.
  Action: For claims 1 and 3, name these neighbours. State what this iteration adds: execution-verified correctness, algorithm-level idea labels rather than lexical diversity, a matched random control and a held-out draw. State where the result disagrees with them (random-direction parity) and give candidate reasons (two-idea menu, 3B model, late layers 29-31).
- [MAJOR MUST-FIX] (rigor) Claim 3 and Table 19 ('five of the ten highest-entropy eligible settings are random controls') rest on an asymmetric comparison. There are 3 random draws per strength at n=75 per task, against single targeted settings at n=150, and the table ranks individual draws. The best of 27 random cells against 10 targeted cells has a selection advantage, and n=75 entropy estimates are noisier, which favours extremes. The noise floor (11-17% label flips) and the anticonservative bootstrap (0.10/0.15 placebo rejection) mean differences of 0.1-0.3 bits are not resolvable here. The iteration answered this with many extra readouts (Table 16 has 14 columns per setting) over the same small panel, not with more samples.
  Action: Recompute claim 3 against draw-averaged random entropy per strength, with a CI across draws and samples. Report how many targeted settings beat the draw mean. If the claim is retained, spend the next budget on more samples per random draw (n=150) and more draws (at least 5), not on more metrics.
- [MAJOR MUST-FIX] (scope) Coverage against the user's request is partial. The user asked for: behavioural analysis first, in the spirit of the repo; temperature questions a/b/c with top-k=10 and a fixed seed; context seeding ('seed=d32qxk4nt43', 'seed=(horse chair roof love)'); whether the model gives the 'average answer'; internal comparison of BFS/DFS/Dijkstra runs with SAE/thought-anchor/NLA-style tools; a path-search manifold coloured by count; and a top-5 ban test of 'edge versus opposite side'. Executed data exist on disk for a/b/c, seeding and the top-5 ban, but are unreported. The manifold exists only as figs/fig_pca_manifold.png without coordinates. No SAE or attribution analysis was attempted, although the plan reserved gemma-2-2b-it for that purpose.
  Action: Name these gaps under 'Open after iteration 1'. Prioritise for iteration 2, in this order: (1) label the temperature and seed generations; (2) write up the ban arm and run the oracle on it; (3) compute the manifold on the ban arm's bare-prompt generations (ban_top5 against baseline centroids at layer 30) using the influence arm's activation code; (4) only then add SAE features, on gemma-2-2b-it with Gemma Scope.
- [MINOR] (evidence) The PCA view (figs/fig_pca_manifold.png) is the run's only partial answer to the user's manifold request, and the report drops it because 'coordinates were not written'. The residuals it was computed from are kept on the run volume (acts/ about 870 MB, caps/ about 926 MB), so the coordinates are recomputable. The figure also shows large non-idea structure: T1 has a spread of about 70 units along PC1 that is not aligned with idea labels, which deserves a note.
  Action: Dump per-condition, per-idea centroid coordinates (PC1, PC2, explained variance) to results/ and add them as a table. Record that PC1 is dominated by non-idea variation.
- [MINOR] (rigor) Claim 6 and the answer to question 8 ('Answered negatively ... zero judge-confirmed novel and correct programs') overreach. The judge only saw passing programs in the catch-all class (70 programs), so passing programs that the AST classifier mapped to a known class were never checked for novelty. And for unweighted and weighted path search, a genuinely new correct algorithm is implausible a priori. A zero on a metric with a floor this hard is weak evidence about the model. The informative observable, off-menu correct share (up to 0.113 for generate-then-select on T1), is barely discussed.
  Action: Rephrase as 'no condition produced a correct program the judge did not recognise; the metric is near-floor by construction on these tasks'. Lead the novelty discussion with off-menu correct share and the A* / bidirectional / IDDFS correct counts per condition.
- [MINOR] (rigor) The A4 Spearman CI looks inconsistent: point estimate 0.486 with 95% CI [-0.029, 0.543] (results.json survival.A4), with the point almost at the upper bound, computed over only 6 strength points. The verdict does not depend on it, but a reader cannot tell how the CI was formed.
  Action: State the bootstrap unit (samples within strength, or strengths) and check the CI. A 6-point Spearman has only a few attainable values, so report the exact permutation p-value instead.
- [MINOR] (clarity) Bookkeeping: Section 1.16 says '111 setting files per task'. gens/ has 111 files on T1 and 81 on T3 (calibration ran on T1 only), and scored/ has 110 and 80 (gts_list.jsonl is stage-1 lists, not scored). The 19,250 total is correct.
  Action: Correct the counts and list the calibration-only files.

Domain handbooks below capture expert knowledge for a specific field — its landscape, prior work, dead ends, evaluation norms, and what counts as a genuinely novel contribution. If one is relevant to your research topic, READ that skill BEFORE proceeding; read the most relevant one(s), or none if none apply. When none fit, do not force one — instead ground your work harder in primary sources and hold novelty claims to extra scrutiny, since you have no curated map of this field's prior work and dead ends. Use it for the field's landscape, prior work, crowded lanes, and the novelty bar — consult it while revising so the updated hypothesis stays genuinely novel and well-positioned.

THIS APPLIES IN ANY FIELD — linguistics, political science, economics, history,
biology, mathematics, computer science, or any mix of them. Where an example
below names a unit of study, read it as whatever your field's equivalent is:
languages, elections, markets, periods, corpora, species, model families, proof
techniques.

THE DEFAULT DELIVERABLE IS A NOVEL CONTRIBUTION. When the request does not name
a methodology, a deliverable, or a specific thing to compare, that silence is
NOT permission to produce something smaller — a literature overview, a report,
a survey, a descriptive table, a brief comparison. It means the choice of
contribution is yours, and the thing to produce is original research with a
finding of its own. Only an explicit request for a review or a replication
changes that.

CALIBRATE AMBITION TO WHAT THE REQUEST LEAVES OPEN. Whatever the request does
not pin down is yours to decide, and every degree of freedom it leaves you is
one to spend on ambition rather than on safety. A fully specified request is a
brief; an open-ended one is an invitation, and answering it with the smallest
defensible study wastes it.

THE TARGET is the most ambitious claim you can still expect to LAND — to finish
within the available resources with a non-trivial, genuinely insightful,
POSITIVE result. Both halves bind. Ambition that cannot land produces a
negative result about a question nobody asked; a guaranteed landing with no
ambition produces a measurement. Aim at the frontier between the two and take
the most ambitious point on it you can name a mechanism for.

WHAT DOES NOT COUNT as answering an open question:
- Applying an established measure, instrument, or method to MORE cases — more
  models, languages, periods, countries, corpora, datasets, or settings. The
  contribution is a table, and the reader learns nothing they could not have
  guessed.
- Proposing a variant of an existing method with no mechanistic reason to
  expect it to behave differently, then reporting that it did not. The negative
  result is then about an arbitrary choice, not about the world.
- Re-describing a known effect in new vocabulary, or naming it.
- A survey, a ranking, or a replication — unless that is what was asked for.

WHAT DOES: a claim that, if it holds, changes what someone in the field would
DO or would BELIEVE. Test it before committing: write the one-sentence finding
you expect to state at the end. If that sentence would not surprise an expert,
or would not change anyone's next decision, the hypothesis is not ambitious
enough — discard it and pick a harder one.

POSITIVE BY DESIGN, NOT BY LUCK. Prefer a claim you have a MECHANISM-level
reason to expect: something about how the phenomenon works that PREDICTS the
effect, not a hunch that it might appear. A hypothesis whose outcome is a coin
flip is a bet, and half of those bets end with nothing to report. Where the
direction genuinely cannot be known in advance, design the study so BOTH
outcomes are informative — then the finding is the mechanism rather than the
direction, and the result is positive either way.

SCALE THE CLAIM, NOT THE AMBITION, when resources bind. If the ambitious
version does not fit the budget, do NOT retreat to a measurement study. Narrow
what the claim COVERS — one language instead of twenty, one period, one
population, one model family — while keeping the mechanism it is about intact.
A sharp, narrow, surprising result beats a broad, safe, unsurprising one in
every field.

<evidence_state_and_move>
This is iteration 1 of 2. There are 1 iteration(s) AFTER this one.
Your revision is the ONLY thing that decides where the next iteration points,
so work the three steps below in order and do not skip to a conclusion.

The run is looking for a POSITIVE, NON-OBVIOUS result. A null is a last
resort, never a destination.

STEP 1 — CLASSIFY EVERY STRAND, SEPARATELY.

A STRAND is ONE artifact of this round: one bet, one test, one attempted
answer. Put EVERY artifact this round produced into `strands` — one entry
each, no merging, no omissions — with `artifact` (its name or id exactly as
listed above), `state`, and `why` (≤200 chars: the number, or the defect).
Rounds are MIXED. Judging a round as a whole is how one real positive gets
thrown away with the nulls around it.

- "genuine_positive" — ALL FOUR must hold:
  (a) the number was EXECUTED, not projected, assumed or placeholder;
  (b) it is at a size the ORIGINAL ask would care about — not the smallest
      size that clears a significance threshold;
  (c) it survived the obvious alternative explanation — the baseline, the
      confound, the simpler account that would produce the same number;
  (d) a reader in the field could NOT have predicted it before you ran it,
      and it is not already published.
- "lead" — real, but not yet genuine. A small effect in the right direction;
  a positive that lost to a baseline or missed a pre-registered bar by a
  margin; a signal seen on ONE body of evidence only. A lead is something to
  CHASE, not something to report.
- "null" — it ran and left nothing to build on: no effect, or one you cannot
  separate from the baseline or from noise.
- "broken" — it never tested the claim. A defect in the code, the data, the
  measure, the sample or the setup, a run that did not finish, or numbers
  that were never executed. The claim is UNTESTED here, not refuted.

STEP 2 — READ THE ROUND SUMMARY OFF THE BEST STRAND.

`evidence_state` is NOT a separate judgement. It is whichever of these fires
first:

- any strand "genuine_positive"  ->  "strong_survivor"
- else any strand "lead"         ->  "lead"
- else any strand "null"         ->  "weak_or_null"
- else (every strand "broken")   ->  "experiment_broken"

STEP 3 — READ THE MOVE OFF THE SUMMARY. A lookup, not a judgement — the
judgement was STEP 1:

- "strong_survivor" -> LATCH ON. `deepen` (why does it hold — the mechanism,
  the boundary where it stops, the confound that would explain it away) or
  `extend` (replication in a SECOND family, population, period, corpus or
  case set). HOLD the title and the object of the positive strand: do not
  rewrite the run around a different question while a real result is alive.
  Null strands of this round are CLOSED — one sentence in the paper, no
  further budget.
- "lead" -> `deepen` ON THAT LEAD. WEAK IS NOT NULL. Make it BIGGER and
  CLEANER before abandoning it: more power, a cleaner measure, the baseline
  it lost to attacked head-on, the second body of evidence it has not been
  seen on. `widen` here ONLY if this same lead was ALREADY deepened last
  round and came back null.
- "weak_or_null" AND at least one iteration remains -> `widen`. MANDATORY.
  Not "consider widening". Every artifact next round is a DIFFERENT bet on
  the ORIGINAL ask; none of them refines the idea that just failed.
- "experiment_broken" -> `fix`, ONCE. Keep the claim EXACTLY as it is, name
  the defect precisely in `move_rationale`, and say what a correct test looks
  like. Do not reframe, soften or re-scope a claim that was never tested.
  BROKEN IS FIXED ONCE: if the SAME bet already came back "broken" in the
  previous round's strands, it is not a defect any more — drop that bet and
  give its slot to a new candidate.
- `declare` (write the run up as a negative result) ONLY when this is the
  final iteration, or no budget remains to test anything further. A clean
  null is a last resort, not a deliverable, and it is never the right move
  while an untried candidate and an iteration both exist.

HOW TO WIDEN, when the rule says widen:

1. Go back to the USER'S ORIGINAL ASK — not to the hypothesis you just
   refuted. The refuted hypothesis was one answer to that ask; the ask is
   still open.
2. Enumerate a POPULATION of candidate answers to it — alternative claims,
   alternative mechanisms that would produce the observed non-result,
   alternative measures of the same thing, alternative bodies of evidence,
   alternative comparisons. Aim for many and cheap, not one and careful.
   Write down how many you weighed.
3. Propose a CHEAP SCREEN that tests all of them at once, coarsely, at a cost
   comparable to one deep test — and a HELD-OUT CONFIRMATION that the screen
   never saw, for whichever candidate survives it.
4. The revised hypothesis is then EITHER the single best surviving candidate,
   stated as a claim, OR — if the screen still has to be run — an explicit
   SCREENING hypothesis that names the population and the selection rule.
   Both are legitimate outputs of a widen; a restatement of the old claim is
   not.

<narrow_salvage_ban>
The failure this procedure exists to stop: a null result, and the revision
quietly shrinks the claim until whatever the data did show becomes the claim
— a smaller population, a milder verb, a subgroup, a weaker measure, an
effect in the direction everyone already expected. Each step is defensible.
The run ends with a finding nobody needed.

What is banned is SHRINKING THE CLAIM TO FIT A NULL. It is NOT a ban on
pursuing a small real effect: keeping a "lead" strand alive and going after
it harder next round is the opposite move, and it is required rather than
forbidden — the claim stays the size it was and the TEST gets stronger.

So: you may not REWRITE the claim down to the size of the effect you happened
to observe, UNLESS the paper can state why that smaller effect is ITSELF the
answer to the ask — a bound someone needed, a mechanism that only shows up at
that size, a belief it overturns. If you cannot write that sentence, the move
is `deepen` on the lead or `widen`, never a smaller claim.
</narrow_salvage_ban>

<screening_discipline>
Widening multiplies the number of claims in play, and a population of
candidates screened on one body of evidence will always contain one that
looks good by chance. So a widen is only honest with the discipline attached:

- Report `candidates_considered` — how many alternative claims you actually
  weighed this revision, not how many you could imagine. 1 means you weighed
  none, and after a weak or null result with budget left, 1 is a failure to
  do the move.
- A candidate is SCREENED on one body of evidence and CONFIRMED on another
  that the screen never touched — a held-out split, a later period, a
  different population, corpus, site, cohort or case set. Say in the revised
  hypothesis which evidence is which.
- The winner of a screen is a CANDIDATE, never yet a finding. Do not write a
  screening result as the answer, and do not report the best of several
  screened effects as though it had been the only one tested.
- Never re-screen on the confirmation evidence after seeing it. If the
  confirmation fails, that candidate is dead; go back to the population, do
  not go hunting for a subgroup where it survives.
</screening_discipline>

COVERAGE. Independently of the move, answer: does the hypothesis you are
about to write still answer the USER'S ORIGINAL ASK? Set `coverage` to
"full" (it answers the ask), "partial" (it answers a recognisable piece of
it) or "lost" (the run has drifted onto a different question), and write one
sentence in `coverage_statement` saying which part of the ask the next
iteration will answer. "lost" is not a failure to hide — it is the signal
that the next iteration must go back to the ask.
</evidence_state_and_move>

<task>
IMPORTANT: Your ONLY output is the revised hypothesis text. Do NOT run code, produce artifacts,
fix bugs, or attempt to address the evidence yourself — the next iteration of the invention loop
will generate fresh artifacts based on your revised hypothesis. Reflect and rewrite; nothing else.

Work the procedure above in order, then write the revision:

1. Classify EVERY artifact of this round separately into `strands` — one entry per artifact,
   no merging, no omissions — judging from what it ACTUALLY produced: an executed number, not
   a projected, assumed or placeholder one. States: `genuine_positive`, `lead`, `null`,
   `broken`.
2. Read the round summary off the BEST strand and set `evidence_state`. It is derived, not
   judged: genuine_positive -> "strong_survivor", else lead -> "lead", else null ->
   "weak_or_null", else "experiment_broken". A summary that disagrees with your own strands
   is rejected.
3. Read the move off the summary. Set `move` and `move_rationale` (≤200 chars). The rule is
   not advisory:
   - "strong_survivor" -> LATCH: `deepen` or `extend` on THAT strand's object, title held.
     The null strands of this round are closed — one sentence in the paper, no more budget.
   - "lead" -> `deepen` on the lead. WEAK IS NOT NULL: make it bigger and cleaner (more
     power, a cleaner measure, the baseline it lost to attacked head-on) before abandoning
     it. Widen off a lead only if it was already deepened last round and came back null.
   - "weak_or_null" with an iteration remaining -> `widen`.
   - "experiment_broken" -> `fix`, once; a bet broken twice is dropped, not fixed again.
   - "declare" only on the final iteration or with no budget left.
4. If the move is `widen`, do the widen properly — go back to the user's ORIGINAL ask,
   enumerate a population of candidate answers, propose a cheap screen over all of them and a
   held-out confirmation for the survivor, and set `candidates_considered` to how many you
   actually weighed. The revised hypothesis is the best surviving candidate, or an explicit
   screening hypothesis naming the population and the selection rule. Every bet the next
   round makes must be a DIFFERENT answer to the ask — none of them refines the failed idea.
5. If the move is `fix`, keep the claim word-for-word and name the defect in `move_rationale`.
6. Set `coverage` and `coverage_statement` against the user's ORIGINAL ask, not against the
   hypothesis you are revising.
7. If reviewer feedback is provided, address the critiques directly. A reviewer asking you to
   shrink a claim is LEGITIMATE when your own strand classification agrees — the effect is a
   `lead` or a `null` — and is to be refused when a `genuine_positive` strand exists: you do
   not shrink a claim the evidence actually supports.

Write the revision as a hypothesis the next iteration can act on: `title`, `hypothesis`,
`key_changes`, and `confidence_delta` ("increased", "decreased" or "unchanged").

You must also classify two kinds of edges in the research trace:

(A) The H↔H edge — bookkeeping only, and NOT the steering decision (`move` is).
    Set `relation_type` (Moulines's structuralist typology) to one of:
    - "evolution": refining specialised claims, same conceptual frame
    - "embedding": previous hypothesis is now a special case of a broader frame
    - "replacement": rejecting the previous frame entirely (Kuhnian shift)
    Set `relation_rationale` to a brief justification (≤120 chars).

(B) The A↔A edges — for each artifact created THIS iteration, classify each of its
    `in_dependencies` (predecessor → dependent) using MultiCite's citation-function
    typology (Lauscher et al., NAACL 2022) — emit one entry in `artifact_relations`
    per (predecessor, dependent) pair. Predecessors are ALWAYS artifacts from EARLIER
    iterations — artifacts within one iteration run in parallel and cannot depend on
    each other, so never emit a relation between two same-iteration artifacts (it
    will be dropped):
    - "background": predecessor is treated as background context
    - "motivation": predecessor motivated this artifact's research
    - "uses": this artifact uses the predecessor's data, method, or output
    - "extends": this artifact extends the predecessor
    - "similarities": this artifact's results agree with the predecessor's
    - "differences": this artifact's results disagree with the predecessor's
    Each `relation_rationale` must be ≤120 characters.

Output the COMPLETE revised hypothesis (with the steering fields and the H↔H relation
fields) AND the full list of A↔A `artifact_relations` for this iteration's new artifacts.

IMPORTANT: this task is NOT complete until `./.terminal_claude_agent_struct_out.json` exists and contains JSON matching the schema above.

take this repo as inspiration: https://github.com/DrejcPesjak/llm-creativity
use one or more open-weight models (minimum 1B params), probably instruction tuned it
and first run behavioral analysis (similar to repo mentioned above), then move to interpretability (can be manifolds, or also other techniques like sae, circuits, nla, j-lens, logit lens...)
the question is: how does "creativity" manifest inside the model, and can we influence it?
(in layman terms, can we make llms give truly creative and novel solutions?)

(you do not need to implement everything bellow, see whats reasonable, interesting and might lead to new insights)
is "temp" really the "llm creativity knob"?  (Astra found "coincidentally" similar direction for navier-stokes solution, as Buckmaster & Levent)
(always same seed)
a) does a tight temp , with topk=10 produce 10 reasoning trajectories of 1 idea/solution but same 10 phrasings
b) or does tight temp, with topk=10 produce 10 reasoning trajectories of 10 ideas/solutions with 1 phrasing each
c) and does loosing up temp, make a) more to 2/3/4 ideas each with 10 phrasings ; or make b) keep original 10 ideas, now each with 10 phrasings
test: "implement path saerch algorithm" -> does llm always design BFS?
can context seeding help? prepand "seed=d32qxk4nt43" or "seed=(horse chair roof love)"
is llm a probablistic model, and thus gives you the average/mean answer? and only context pushes you into a different subspace
 - ie of possible range of answer [0,100] , on direct question llm gives you 50. then with context you move to [80,100] subspace and llm gives you 90
so how much does prompt instructions matter? ("Make a new algorithm", "Make a fully novel algorithm never seen before ... 2000 words ..."
-> analyze the internals , all the runs that produced BFS , vs all runs that produced DFS , vs dijkstra ...
  -> analyze with thought anchors, NLA, SAE ...
  -> what is the average answer? plot a "path search algorithm" manifold, color each algorithm centroid by implemented-count (lets say we have 10 algorithms in total of 100 gens)
     -> then prohibit the top 5 in prompt, and see if the implemented count moves to the edge of those 5, or to the opposite side (if its a circle manifold)
  - (manifold lit: https://arxiv.org/pdf/2605.05115 , https://www.goodfire.com/research/manifold-steering )
